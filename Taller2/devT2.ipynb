IntroductionParkinson disease PD is the second most common neurodegen-erative disease. Its a slowly progressive highly debilitating disordermainly aecting the motor system with bradykinesia resting tremorrigidity and posture instability Kalia and Lang . Its progressioncan be divided into three stages  preclinical stage where the de-generative process already commenced but neither symptoms or signsare present  prodromal stage where several symptoms or signs canbe observed but they are not sucient to make a PD diagnosis clinical stage where the classical motor symptoms appear and it ispossible to make a diagnosis. PD in Western countries aects the .of the population aged  years. The prevalence strongly increasesacross decades with a doubling of the number of patients over the next years aected by this disease that means more than  millionpatients worldwide by about  Ascherio and Schwarzschild .The gold standard treatment for PD is levodopa a precursor ofdopamine which is well tolerated and allows a satisfactory control ofmotor symptoms. Nevertheless three major clinical issues still remainunsolved  the development of preventive strategies targeting theneurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons at the basis of the disease the management of long-term treatment-related complications i.e.levodopa-induced dyskinesia LID and  the treatment of axialsymptoms which poorly respond or not respond at all to levodopa andthus represent a major therapeutic challenge in the management of PDpatients.Concerning the former issue  a critical role is played by the earlyprodromal symptoms. Actually at the time of motor symptoms ap-pearance already  of dopaminergic synapses are died and even if aneuroprotective agent would exist it would be too late to be eectiveMaetzler et al. . To identify early markers of neurodegenerationwould be a critical step in the ght against the disease.Sleep disturbances are indeed extremely very common in PD beingoften the earliest manifestation of the disease and thus representing theCorresponding author at Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland Via Tesserete   Lugano TI Switzerland.E-mail address salvatore.galatieoc.ch S.

Amato et al.Journal of Neuroscience Methods   most likely candidate for helping in predicting its onset.Motor symptoms in PD are in fact often accompanied by sleepdisorders which frequently precede the development of the diseaseitself. Rem sleep behavior disorder RBD and restless leg syndromeRLS are two of the most common sleep disturbances reported topossibly appear before the clinical stage of the disease. Sleep archi-tecture itself has been reported to be altered in PD patients often ex-periencing reduced sleep eciency increased number of awakeningsarousals and increased wake after sleep onset WASO. Of note slowwave sleep SWS is dramatically reduced in PD.Concerning the latter issue  no clinically eective medicaltherapies are able to alleviate LID without worsening parkinsonism andalso the serotoninergic receptor agonists claimed to be drugs againstLID Muoz et al.  were ineective Huot et al. . Pre-liminary nding from our lab suggested a link between slow wave ac-tivity SWA alteration and LID development Amato et al. . Sleepdisturbances not only may precede the onset of motor symptoms buthypothetically it may have an impact on the progression of the diseaseitself and it may eventually alter its phenotype. We hypothesize that therelationship between SWA abnormality and LID development may havea causative nature with the SWA alteration helping in determining theappearance of dyskinetic symptoms. Further studies are needed tobetter understand the nature of this link. If the disruption of the phy-siological SWA will be conrmed to have a causative eect on theemergence of LID early alteration of SWA could be considered a markerfor LID development and could thus provide prognostic information.it could pave the way for pioneering SWA targetedFurthermoretherapies in PD.Polysomnography PSG is the gold standard method to study sleepand its disorders. PSG with high-density electroencephalographyhdEEG-PSG montage are nowadays frequently used to investigatesleep. These systems allow to overcome the low spatial resolution is-sues typical of low-density EEG recordings resulting in a deeper in-vestigation of sleep characteristics.Aim of this paper is to outline the diagnostic and prognostic value ofthe hdEEG-PSG in the evaluation of patients suering with PD.. PolysomnographyThenightfunction.rst wholePSG permits to record simultaneously and continuously multiplephysiological parameters during sleep allowing the identication ofsleep stages the monitoring of body movement and the assessment ofcardiopulmonaryelectro-encephalography EEG recording was performed in the late sLoomis et al. . This recording permitted to distinguish  dif-ferent sleep stages that the authors dened A interrupted alpha stageB low voltage stage C spindles stage D spindles plus random stageand E random stage. In the early s the electro-oculogram EOGwas added to the EEG allowing the denition of rapid eye movementREM sleep Aserinsky and Kleitman  then in order to in-vestigate the lack of muscle tone observed during REM sleep surfaceelectromyographic EMG channels were added over the chin. Later inthe s the discovery of the apnea syndrome lead to the need ofrecording respiratory and cardiac channels in order to assess these re-spiratory events Jung and Kuhlo . In the  a committee ofsleep researchers dened the so called the Rechtschaen and Kalescriteria for recording and scoring sleep stages Rechtschaen and Kales. This was a turning point in the history of PSG. Nowadays inclinical practice a standard PSG includes the recording of severalparameters EOG EMG of chin and anterior tibialis muscles oro-nasalairow nasal cannula microphone thoracic and abdominal eortpiezoelectric strain gauges and arterial oxygen saturation pulse oxi-metry with nger probe. Other parameters could be measured as forclinical recommendation Fig. .It is performed in a standard sound-attenuated sleep laboratoryroom. Subjects are usually asked not to drink caeinated beveragesbefore the beginning of the exam. Lights-o time is possibly based onthe individuals usual bed time. Sleep staging is performed by sleepexperts according to the standard criteria of the American Associationof Sleep Medicine AASM Iber et al. ... PSG role in detecting sleep disorders appearing before motor symptoms... REM sleep behavior disorders in PDREM sleep is characterized by fast frequency low voltage EEG re-sembling wake EEG associated with rapid eyes movements occurringisolated or in bursts and lack of muscle tone. The principal brainstructures implicated in generating REM sleep are the pons and themidbrain. Indeed massive lesions of these structures lead to the abo-lition of REM whereas selective lesions in smaller portion of these re-gions can aect it only partially. For instance damage to small portionsof the pons and medulla can lead to REM sleep occurring without thenormal lack of muscle tone Schenkel and Siegel . RBD is char-acterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia associated with REMsleep Fig. such that patients seem to act out their dreams.RBD prevalence in PD is estimated to be over  Zhang et al. appearing even decades before motor symptoms Iranzo et al..According to the International Classication of Sleep Disorders IIIICSD III the clinical diagnosis of RBD needs two criteria to be con-sidered the lack of REM sleep atonia at a whole night PSG recordingand an abnormal REM sleep behavior Schenck and Mahowald Boeve . The rst criterium is satised by the nding of excessiveamounts of sustained or intermittent elevations of submentalis muscleEMG tone or excessive phasic submentalis muscle twitching or upperlower limbs.Subjects presenting this disorder can be considered at-risk in-dividuals for developing Parkinsons disease which makes their earlyrecognition essential in order to have the opportunity to evaluate pos-sible neuroprotective agents for PD. Furthermore a new diagnosis ofRBD should thus be considered as an alarm bell and should lead to thesearch for existing subtle signs of Parkinsons disease..... Quantication of muscle atonia. The lack of muscle tone duringREM sleep can be quantied calculating the atonia index AI an indexdening the amount of muscle tone during REM presented andvalidated by Ferri et al. . The submentalis muscle EMG activityis ltered between  and  Hz. A notch lter is also applied. Thesignal is then rectied. Each sleep epoch considered is then segmentedinto  sec length mini-epoch and a mean amplitude value is obtained.The authors observed that mini-epochs characterized by muscle atoniapresented a mean amplitude value less then or equal to  V whereasmini-epochs characterized by phasic or tonic muscle activationpresented a mean amplitude value greater than  V. Then using thevalues obtained the authors drew normalized distribution histogramsfor each sleep stage of the percentage of values in the following amplitude classes with high values of the rst left column of the graphreecting muscle atonia and high values ofthe other columnsreecting instead phasic and tonic muscle activations. Ferri et al. then dened an index summarizing in a single value thedegree of preponderance of the rst column in the graphs AI  amp  -  amp  .AI can go from  that means complete absence of EMG atonia to that means stable EMG atonia throughout the epoch considered.... Restless leg syndrome in PDRLS is a sleep related movement disorder described by patients asunpleasant or even painful sensations in the legs accompanied by anurge to move them. Its characterized by motor restlessness associatedwith paresthesias. It has a circadian pattern occurring mostly duringrest therefore having an impact on sleep with the patients showingdicultiesin maintaining sleep due to theto fall asleep or\\x0cN.

Prevalence is much higher in PD with RLS af-fecting up to  of the patients Braga-Neto  Gama et al. .The link between these two pathologies appears even more evidentconsidering the common responsiveness to dopaminergic therapy. Inthe last two decades a growing body of literature has suggested acommon pathophysiology in RLS and PD Nomura et al. \\x0cN. Amato et al.Journal of Neuroscience Methods   GmezEsteban et al.  Guerreiro et al.  Verbaan et al. Azmin et al.  Fereshtehnejad et al.  Ylikoski et al. .Some other studies instead suggested that RLS in PD could be a sec-ondary symptom induced by the disease symptomatology and therapyLee et al.  Angelini et al.  Oh et al. . However a muchhigher prevalence of PD development in RLS patients has been alsodocumented Walters et al.  Gao et al. . Although RLS is notyet considered as an established early feature of PD recent studiespointed in this direction. Indeed severe RLS symptoms with a fre-quency   times per months have been reported to be associatedwith the development of PD in the successive  years Wong et al.. Moreover a recent case series described several patients pre-senting with RLS as prodromal symptom of PD Suzuki et al. .These ndings suggest that RLS could represent a possible prodromalsymptom of PD. PSG then could play a role in the diagnosis of thesepatients eventually being helpful in recognizing individuals that willpossibly move forward to the clinical stage.LM.... Criteria for recording and scoring PLM. In  and again in a joint task force of experts on the topic developed and redenedthe criteria for recording and scoring PLM in polysomnogram. The mostinvolved muscle in periodic movement activity during sleep is theanterior tibialis thus it is recommended to record its activity for thispurpose Fig. . A subset of leg monolateral movements with a lengthbetween . and  sec or bilateral movements with a length between. and  sec are considered candidate leg movements CLM. A legis dened as an EMG event having an onsetmovementcharacterized by an EMG activity increase greater than or equal to V above resting baseline an oset characterized by an EMG activitydecrease less than  V above resting baseline and remaining below thisthreshold for at least . sec a duration greater than or equal to . secand containing a period of at least . sec in which the median EMGamplitude is greater than or equal to  V above resting baseline. CLMwill then be evaluated for PLM. An inter movement interval IMIrepresenting the time from the onset of CLMn to the onset of CLMn without any non-CLM in between has to be dened. IMI musthave a length greater than or equal to  sec and less than or equal to sec for the consecutive CLM to be considered potential PLM. The runmust count at least  CLM separated by three appropriate IMI to bedened PLM. A PLM series is considered terminated when one of thefollowing appears an IMI longer than  sec a CLM with an IMI shorterthan  sec a LM longer than  sec.A more detailed description of the standards for recording andscoring PLM is beyond the scope of this review thus for a more completetreatment of the reader should refer to Ferri et al. ... PSG role in detecting early signs of long-term treatment-relatedcomplications... hdEEG-PSGIn recent years EEG systems with a much higher number of sensorsincluding up to became available. This kind of montageselectrodes permitted to overcome the low spatial resolution issuescharacterizing low-density EEG recordings Fig. . The introduction ofhigh-density systems was crucial for sleep research in fact the higherspatial resolution allowed a much more accurate topographical map-ping of the main frequency band characterizing sleep. Specic EEGactivities during sleep are known. The most prominent is the SWAdominant during SWS which is characterized by high amplitude lowvoltage waves with a frequency ranging between . and  Hz.The increment in the number of channels used for recording the EEGactivity allowed a characterization of the link between SWA andlearning. Previous studies using hdEEG-PSGindeed showed thatlearning tasks leaded to the occurrence of a greater amount of SWAover the brain region involved in the task. Moreover the SWA increaseobserved during the night following the task was directly correlatedwith an improvement in the task performance. These local changes inSWA need a sucient number of channels to be detected. Authors in-vestigated the eect of electrode downsampling on the detection ca-pacity and documented that reducing the electrode number below dramatically decrease the probability to detect local changes in SWALustenberger and Huber. . These ndings highlighted the closeconnection between plastic changes occurring in the brain and the localregulation of SWA Huber et al.  Huber et al.  Hung et al..... Slow wave activity and Levodopa Induced DyskinesiaThe ability of the brain to modify its functions in a long-lasting waythrough changes at the level of the interneuronal connections in re-sponse to stimulations is called synaptic plasticity.The interaction with the environment during the waketime leads tosynaptic potentiation due to plasticity mechanisms. During sleep neu-rons have to renormalize total synaptic strength thus the daytime sy-naptic upscaling is followed by a sequent selective downscaling processoccurring mainly during the rst part of the night-sleep. This phe-nomenon restores the synaptic balance and follows the same trend ofthe so-called homeostatic process of sleep. The amount of SWA duringSWS SWA-SWS occupying the rst part of the night represents themain electrophysiological marker of the homeostatic process beingenhanced by the duration of wakefulness preceding the sleep occur-rence Fig. . By this mechanism sleep plays a crucial role in neuro-plasticity restoring neuronal selectivity and enhancing signal-to-noiseleading to the consolidation and integration of memoriesratiosTononi and Cirelli .Direct structural visualization studies measured synaptic densityand axon-spine interface contact surface between axonal button anddendritic spine in the motor and sensory cortices of mice nding areduction of synaptic burden after sleep compared to wake demon-strating that synaptic scale occurs during sleep De Vivo et al. .Similarly electrophysiological evidences in humans show that tran-scranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked response in the frontalcortex has a progressive increase of slope during wake and returns tobaseline levels after one night of sleep recovery Huber et al. .Several evidences support the hypothesis that SWA-SWS is crucialFig. .

Previous ndings in fact documented alink between SWA mediated synaptic downscaling disruption and thedevelopment of LID in PD.Thus sleep disturbances appear not only to have a prognostic valuein the assessment of PD patients but there is a possibility that it mighteven change the phenotype of this neurological condition leading to theemergence of LID. If this hypothesis will be conrmed by further stu-dies monitoring the alteration of this physiological process in PD pa-tients by means of periodic hdEEG-PSG could be helpful in predictingthe emergence of LID and would ultimately oer a platform for testingpossible sleep targeted therapies able to protect the patients from thedevelopment of this treatment-related complication.Fig. . Graphical representation of the dierence in the power of the slow waveactivity SWA between early and late sleep.for the restoration of synaptic homeostasis Tononi and Cirelli Tononi and Cirelli  Galati et al. . The increase in synapseformation and strengthening during the wakefulness is optimizedduring sleep through a global downscaling of all the synapses. Parti-cularly redundant synaptic connections are erased through the long-lasting burst ring which is common in SWA during transitions be-tween intracellular up and down states Nelson and Turrigiano Tatavarty et al.  Tononi and Cirelli . All the data recognizedSWA-SWS as an index as well as a contributor of the downscaling ofcortical synaptic strength.Sleep architecture is well known to be altered in PD patients fre-quently showing a reduced amount of SWS Diederich et al. Galati et al.  Bchele et al.  Caverzasio et al. .To investigate sleep alterations in PD is essential in order to evaluatethe possible impact of these alterations on the likelihood of developingshortly a long-term treatment-related complications such as LID.In both animal models and patients with PD a change in the amountof SWA-SWS has been observed Galati et al.  Amato et al. .Of note Schreiner et al.  found that higher amount of SWA had aclear prognostic meaning in terms of slower motor progression in acohort of PD patients. The amount of SWA-SWS has been reported to benegatively correlated with the duration of the disease and appears to beespecially low in PD patients presenting LID Amato et al. . InreectingofSWAparameters.... Evaluationsynapticdownscaling. According to the synaptic homeostatic hypothesis SHYSWA reects changes in the synaptic strength Tononi and Cirelli Tononi and Cirelli . This hypothesis suggesting a link betweenSWA and plasticity has been widely supported Huber et al. Huber et al.  Mascetti et al. . Several SWA parameters i.e.the dierence between early and late sleep SWA power or the overnightchange in the slope of the waves Achermann and Borbly Riedner et al.  have been reported to reect the synapticdownscaling process.To investigate these parameters a whole night hdEEG-PSG has to berecorded. The EEG recording is then o-line band pass ltered oftenbetween . and  Hz and visually inspected. Bad channels and ar-tifacts are rejected. Sleep staging is obtained according to standardcriteria Berry et al. . Non-rapid eye movement NREM sleepepisodes are dened. Although the rst and the last sixty minutes ofNREM sleep are frequently selected for further analysis we recommendto extract the NREM sleep of the whole night since the population athand shows a severely fragmented sleep and this fragmentation couldpotentially have an impact on the presentation time of the N peakwhich is the sleep stage showing the greater amount of SWA. Afterselecting the appropriate part of the recording a quantitative analysisof the EEG is performed by means of a decomposition method such asthe fast Fourier transform FFT used to obtain the frequency compo-nents constituting the EEG signal which is a time-domain signal. Thebackbone of many technique used to extract frequency informationfrom a time-domain signal is the convolution. The backbone of the\\x0cN. Amato et al.Journal of Neuroscience Methods   convolution is a basic procedure called dot product which consistsvery roughly in multiplying each element in vector A by the corre-sponding element in vector B and then summing all the points. Con-volution is a kind of dot product computed repeatedly. It consists insliding sine waves known as kernel of dierent frequencies vector Aalong the EEG signal vector B. The result obtained shows how muchthe signal and the kernel are similar. It is important to opportunelywindowing the data when an FFT is applied. A windowing function forinstance a Hanning window should be applied to minimize the eect ofspectral leakage. The FFT indeed assumes the data set to be a con-tinuous spectrum representing one period of a periodic signal but mostof the times the measured signal doesnt contain an integer number ofperiods. This results in discontinuous endpoints which appear in theFFT as high frequency components. Thus the spectrum obtained is asmeared version of the actual one that looks like if the energy at onefrequency leaks into other frequencies. Multiplying by a window i.e.windowing that have an amplitude that smoothly goes to zero at theedges makes the waveform resulting in a kind of a continuous wave-form without discontinuities. It is important also to consider that theFFT needs the signal to be stationary. It is not the case for the EEGsignal whose non-stationarity is due to several reasons among whichthe main one is represented by the changes in states of neuronal as-semblies. This limitation is overcome by selecting very small epochslasting few seconds along which the parameters of interest show aneglectable variance. The length of the segment is of course a com-promise between stationarity and frequency resolution the latter beingdened as n where n is the length in seconds of the selected epoch.The spectra calculated with the FFT one for each epoch will then beaveraged. The power value obtained for each channel is then normal-ized to the average of all channels. Topographical dierences in SWAbetween early and late sleep reecting the physiological synapticdownscaling process are then assessed.Another reliable measure of this process is the slope of the slowwaves which has been reported to signicantly decrease throughoutthe night. This analysis is performed in the time domain. To assess theslope of the wave after oine band pass ltering the signal and re-moving artefacts half waves dened as negative deections betweentwo zero crossing whose consecutive zero crossings are separated by. to . seconds are selected on each channel. For every half wavethe point in time of the zero-crossings and the peak amplitude are de-ned. Since very roughly speaking the slope is calculated as the risedivided by the run the amplitude is divided by the time from the zerocrossing obtaining a value representing the slope ofthe wave.Dierences in this parameter between early and late sleep are thenassessed.. ConclusionSleep disturbances are well known to be extremely common in PD.Evidence from a growing number of studies supports the idea of thepossible prodromal nature of these disturbances appearing even dec-ades before the classical motor symptomatology. A major problem indiagnosing PD at the appearance of motor symptoms is that most of thedopaminergic synapses are died at that time and even if a neuropro-tective agent would exist it would be too late to provide any protectionagainst the progression of the disease. To identify early markers ofneurodegeneration would be essential in order to see an eect of apossible protective agent. An early recognition of sleep disorders suchas RBD and RLS would provide a time window to search for earlysubclinical signs of PD and to test neuroprotective agents. PSG being alow-cost non-invasive method useful in the diagnosis of sleep disordercould play an important role at this stage.PSG could be a crucial methodology to be applied also later onduring the course of the disease.Sleep macrostructure alterations hugely common in PD patientsleading frequently to an invalidating excessive daytime sleepinessmight eventually have also a negative impact on the diseases pheno-type itself fostering the emergence of complication due to the pro-longed therapy. If the link between the amount of SWS -and specicallyseveral parameters of its SWA such as the power and the slope of thewaves- and LID development will be conrmed and the nature of thisrelationship will be claried monitoring these sleep parameters couldeventually pave the way for exploring SWA enhancing pioneeringtherapies able to delay the emergence of this invalidating treatment-related complication.AcknowledgementsFoundation for the Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases of Adultsand Elderly People in Ticino and Parkinson Schweiz provided nancialsupport to S.G.Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of thearticle before the references and do not therefore include them on thetitle page as a footnote to the title or otherwise.

This indicatesthe need for accurate assessment of non-dopaminergic diseaseseverity during the preoperative selection process.Clinical neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations areused to rule out severe cognitive decline or psychiatric comorbid-ity. However several factors including intelligence education andpersonality limit the interpretability of clinimetric assessmentsDuncan . Moreover questionnaires and performance tasksare susceptible to misinterpretation social desirability bias or fati-gue Duckworth et al. . Therefore there is a need for comple-mentary measures reecting disease severity in PD to aid theidentication of DBS candidates.Quantitative Electroencephalography qEEG is an inexpensiveand widely available tool which measures brain activity directly.Previous studies applied qEEG to examine clinical domains in PDsuch as cognition Caviness et al.  Cozac et al. response to treatment George et al.  or motor impairmentBabiloni et al.  George et al. . Global oscillatory slow-ing of the EEG spectrogram is a highly suitable biomarker for cog-nitive impairment in PD Caviness et al. . Recent advances inneurophysiology have provided more complex markers such asconnectivity parameters and graph theory estimations whichquantify brain network disorganization. The Phase-Lag IndexPLI which reects functional connectivity was suggested as apotential biomarker of PD dementia Utianski et al. . Toour knowledge the relation of qEEG parameters to measures ofnon-dopaminergic severity in PD has not been investigated sofar. We aimed to investigate whether qEEG correlates with clinicalmeasures of disease severity in order to ultimately provide neuro-physiological determinants of disease severity.. Methods.. Study participantsAll consecutive PD patients who were referred for preoperativescreening to the DBS center of Leiden University Medical CenterLUMC and Haga Teaching Hospital between September and July  were included in the study. All patients fullledthe Movement Disorders Society PD criteria for clinically estab-lished PD Postuma et al. . Written informed consent wasobtained from all patients. A formal ethical evaluation of this studywas waived by the local medical ethics committee... Outcome measuresMotor function was assessed with the Movement DisordersSociety Unied Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale MDS-UPDRS partIII Goetz et al.  range  whereas the SEverity of Non-dopaminergic Symptoms in Parkinsons Disease SENS-PD scalequantied non-dopaminergic disease severity van der Heedenet al.  range . The SENS-PD scale is a composite scorecomprising three items with four response options range from each of the following six predominantly non-dopaminergicdomains postural instability and gait difculty PIGD psychoticsymptoms excessive daytime sleepiness EDS autonomic dys-function cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms vander Heeden et al. . These six domains represent a coherentcomplex of symptoms that is already present in early diseasestages and increases in severity with age and advancing disease.The SENS-PD scale is a recently developed short reliable and validscale that includes symptoms that do not improve with dopamin-ergic medication and may therefore more accurately reect sever-ity and progression of the underlying disease than currently useddopamine-sensitive measures. Higher scores on both the MDS-UPDRS III and SENS-PD scale reect more severe impairment.Patients were subdivided a posteriori into three groups of com-parable size according to the tertile in which their SENS-PD scorefell low disease severity range intermediate severityrange  and high severity range ... EEG recording and pre-processingEEGs were recorded with patients lying supine with eyes closedduring a state of relaxed wakefulness. Light was kept at moderateintensity. AgAgCl EEG electrodes were placed on the scalp using standard  EEG electrode positions. Additional ECG and hor-izontal eye movement leads were added for identication of arti-facts. Data were acquired online using a Nihon Kohden EEG-system with a  Hz sampling rate a -bit analog-to-digital con-verter and band-ltered between . and  Hz. An EEG technicianmonitored signal quality throughout the entire recording patientswere alerted by acoustic stimuli upon drowsiness. All patients useddopaminergic medication according to their individual schedule... EEG analysisEEG data were re-referenced towards a source derivation whichapproaches the surface Laplacian derivation Hjorth .

The individual epochs were ofine convertedto American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCIIformat and further analysed using Brainwave software BrainWaveversion .... C.J. Stam available at httphome.kpn.nlstambrainwave.html. Recordings with lessthan veartifact-free epochs were excluded from analysis. Analyses wereperformed in signal space to allow for direct analysis of the rawEEG data in Brainwave software which is easily reproducible formost clinicians and may increase the utility of our ndings.Spectral analysis was performed off-line by processing eachepoch with a Fast Fourier Transform FFT and averaged to producea power spectrum for each individual electrode. The frequencybands were dened as d .. Hz h .. Hz a.. Hz a .. Hz and b .. Hz. c bandpower was not analysed due to frequent contamination with mus-cle artifacts. Relative bandpower was calculated by dividing theabsolute bandpower of each frequency band by the total absolutebandpower from the FFT average per channel. Regional band pow-ers were dened as frontal for F F F F and Fz temporal forT T T and T parietal for P P and Pz central for C Cand Cz and occipital for O and O. Global bandpower was denedas the average of all regional band powers. A spectral ratio was cal-culated by dividing the sum of the relative power in the d and hbands by the sum of the relative power in the a and b bands. Thesespectral bands were selected a priori to incorporate as much of theEEG spectrum as possible without contaminating the results withpossible artefacts that may be present in the fast frequency bands.Functional connectivity was assessed by calculating the PLI ineach frequency band. The PLI quanties phase coupling range whilst being insensitive to common sources and volume con-duction.

DiscussionSeveral qEEG parameters were found to have potential as neu-rophysiological determinants of advanced non-dopaminergic dis-ease severity in PD.

Average network maps of the mean PLI in the a band per tertile of disease severity. The a PLI network maps are plotted at three thresholds PLI  . . and.. A line indicates a level of functional connectivity of at least the threshold-value. With higher SENS-PD scores the threshold for functional connectivity is loweredindicating a greater degree of cortical desynchronization with increased disease severity.previously suggested that diffuse cortical slowing in PD reects adegeneration of a non-dopaminergic system with ascending corti-cal projections Olde Dubbelink et al.  which seems compat-ible with the observed correlation between clinical measures ofnon-dopaminergic disease severity and EEG slowing.Cortical slowing has been associated with severity of psychi-atric symptoms also in other conditions. In schizophrenic patientsauditory hallucinations were associated with task-related h slow-ing Zheng et al.  and in cases with a delirium visual hallu-cinations were associated with h-d slowing Teeple et al. .Although results of these studies based on other diseases maynot be directly comparable with PD we speculate that these nd-ings suggest a more general cortical desynchronization rather thannetwork alterations that are specic to PD.Reduced functional connectivity in the a band signicantlycorrelated with higher non-dopaminergic disease severity particu-larly with cognition with a similar trend for the subdomains psy-chotic symptoms depression PIGD and EDS. Motor impairmentdid not correlate with functional connectivity. Only one EEG-study previously investigated PLI in PD reporting reduced a PLIvalues in demented PD patients relative to cognitively normal PDpatients. a PLIlikewise correlated with the MMSE scaleUtianski et al. . Reduced a PLI values were also found tocorrelate with increased severity in Alzheimers Disease ADEngels et al. . Our results indicate a non-signicant trendfor a PLI whereas we found a PLI to be signicantly reduced.This discrepancy can be explained by a difference in populationas previous studies investigated patients with more advancedcognitive deterioration while our population did not includedemented PD patients being this a contra-indication for the DBSscreening procedure. However these ndings suggest that desyn-chronization of a similar a-band either a or a network mightunderlie cognitive deterioration in both PD and AD.The described qEEG parameters both oscillatory slowing andfunctional connectivity demonstrate discriminative ability at agroup-level and may be further investigated to determine theirpotential as biomarkers at an individual level.Strengths of our study are the large sample size of consecutivelyincluded patients standardized examinations and use of a noveland validated clinimetric scale SENS-PD. A limitation of theSENS-PD scale is that the different subdomains may reect differ-indicating that similar scores betweenent systems-at-riskpatients may reect altogether different phenotypes although thisholds true for any multidimensional scale including the MDS-UPDRS III. From a clinical perspective not all symptoms may beequally important therefore the correlations with the SENS-PDscale were studied both for the composite scores and its subdo-mains. Our study population consisted of potential candidates forDBS. Typically these patients had severe motor symptoms withoutobvious clinical signs of cognitive dysfunction or psychotic symp-toms. This homogeneity constitutes both a limitation and astrength although it is currently unknown whether our resultscan be generalised to all PD patients we show that qEEG is capableof quantifying subtle differences in patients with cognitive andpsychiatric symptoms that might go unnoticed in a global clinicalimpression. Investigations in a wider range of PD patients at differ-ent disease stages are likely to show even more pronounced corre-lations. Consequently qEEG biomarkers for non-dopaminergic\\x0cV.J. Geraedts et al.  Clinical Neurophysiology   disease severity at different disease-stages could have clinicalapplicability beyond DBS screening such as monitoring of diseaseprogression.The two applied methods of qEEG analysis do not show identi-cal correlations with non-dopaminergic domains suggesting thatthey address different functional aspects. The negative associationof cortical connectivity in the a band with cognitive impairmentbut the lack of correlation with the other non-motor domains mayreect the subcortical nature of the latter. Whereas a-band con-nectivity is associated with cognition it is not specically limitedto cognition as evidenced by a non-signicant trend in the domainpsychotic symptoms. Although subcortical networks inuencecortical processes Boon et al.  the exact subcortical alter-ations are not properly visualized by EEG which accounts for thedifferent results. Likewise the lack of correlation between motorfunctioning and EEG slowing provides further evidence that sever-ity of motor impairment as assessed by the MDS-UPDRS III is notreected by cortical slowing Babiloni et al. . Indeed oscilla-tory alterations in the subcortical basal ganglia which correlatewith motor dysfunction Brittain et al.  cannot be capturedby EEG. Magnetoencephalography MEG could investigate thesesubcortical networks Boon et al.  however MEG is notwidely available and is less applicable for routine DBS screeningpurposes. Previous longitudinal studies using MEG have identiedslowing of oscillatory brain activities to be correlated with globaldisease progression in PD Olde Dubbelink et al. .A limitation of the applicability of EEG as a biomarker is the pro-portion of excluded patients due to EEG artifacts. These artifactsare partly inherent to the disease itself such as altered muscletone increased ocular movements tremor dyskinesias and sleepi-ness. As baseline characteristics both motor and non-motor sever-ity did not differ between included and excluded patients weexpect that the incidence of artifacts is not associated with diseaseseverity. This is also conrmed by the fact that in our cohort thenumber of recordings excluded because of artefacts was compara-ble in the low disease severity group and high disease severitygroup.Several factors might inuence EEG activity such as aging oruse of psychoactive medication. For this reason we corrected ourresults for both factors. Careful consideration of normal age-related alterations cannot be neglected when assessing individualEEGs.Changes of spectral and connectivity parameters have also beenfound in epilepsy Liang et al.  AD Engels et al.  andschizophrenia John et al.  but it remains unclear whetherthese disorders have a common cortical denominator or whetherthere are different disease-specic network alterations.EEG is available in every hospital readily accessible and cheaperthan other functional neuroimaging measures such as MEG fMRIPET or SPECT Lystad et al. . Moreover source referencingamplied the spatial resolution overcoming criticism of EEGs lim-ited resolution Burle et al. . Whereas the -channel EEGsetup could be enhanced by using a high-density setup we demon-strated that conventional routine EEG is sufcient to provideparameters of non-dopaminergic disease severity. Advanced set-ups do not seem necessary to achieve sufcient discriminativeability on a group-level. In this study we demonstrate that diseaseseverity is accurately reected by both functional connectivity andsimpler EEG spectral measures which are calculated with relativeease by neurophysiologists. Future research could focus on valida-tion in larger and more heterogeneous cohorts to investigatewhether qEEG may serve as biomarkers at an individual leveland determine its accuracy in estimating disease severity. Theuse of EEG parameters to aid the selection process of DBS candi-dates should also be further investigated.In conclusion we have demonstrated that both EEG slowingand reduced functional connectivity in the a band are associatedwith increased non-dopaminergic disease severity in PD particu-larly with cognitive impairment and psychotic symptoms. TheseEEG alterations were apparent both globally and over separatebrain regions. The studied qEEG parameters may have the potentialto ultimately serve as complementary biomarkers of non-dopaminergic disease severity in PD.Conict of interestThis work was supported by a grant from the Stichting Parkin-sonFonds and the Stichting Alkemade-Keuls.

Alpha activity on EEG has been related to cognition in pre-vious  studies.  We  aimed  to  investigate  the  correlation  between  alpha  activity  and  neuropsychometric  tests NPTs in PD patients. Fifty-five idiopathic PD patients and  healthy controls were included. The Standardized Mini-Mental Test SMMT Verbal Learning Memory Test VLMT Wechsler Memory Scale WMS Stroop Col-orWord Test Categorical Verbal Fluency Test CVFT Bentons Face Recognition Test BFR and Benton Line Judgment  Orientation  Test  BLOT  were  administered  to  all  participants.  Patients  were  separated  into  four groups according to NPT results healthy controls HC PD patients with normal cognition PDNC PD patients with MCI PDMCI and PD patients with dementia PDD. Analysis of the EEG data showed that HC had the highest alpha activity and PDD had the lowest. High SMMT scores were correlated with high alpha activity at posterior electrode locations in all PD groups. VLMT and WMS test scores were associated with alpha activity at the  parietal  sites  in  PDMCI.  VLMT  WMS  and  CVFT  test  scores  were  correlated  with  alpha  activity  at  parie-tooccipital sites in PDD. Verbal and visuospatial memory dysfunction related to low alpha activity was evident in both PDMCI and PDD whereas executive dysfunction was more strongly associated with low alpha activity in PDD.  Analysis  of  alpha  activity  could  help  clinicians  predict  the  progression  of  cognitive  dysfunction  in  PD patients.   . Introduction Parkinsons  disease  PD  is  a  neurodegenerative  disease  charac-terised by both motor findings bradykinesia rigidity rest tremor and non-motor  findings.  Cognitive  impairment  is  one  of  the  non-motor manifestations  with  half  of  patients  complaining  about  forgetfulness and  a  lack  of  attention  when  they  are  questioned  thoroughly  . Approximately   of PD patients have dementia  and   of the nondemented group have mild cognitive impairment MCI . Mem-ory impairment and executive and visuospatial dysfunction are the most common cognitive disorders in PD . The spontaneous alpha rhythm observed on electroencephalography EEG  is  known  to  be  related  to  cognition  and  alpha  activity  is correlated with working memory and probably with long-term memory . A functional network analysis of EEG revealed different character-istics  among  healthy  aging  MCI  and  Alzheimers  groups  .  In studies with PD patients slowing on EEG is more common with cogni-tive dysfunction  and slowing in global average EEG frequency is positively  correlated  with  attention  executive  function  fluency  and episodic long-term memory tests . However the literature provides little information about the correlation of alpha activity on EEG with detailed neuropsychiatric tests NPTs. This study aimed to compare spontaneous alpha activity recorded at rest in patients with PD and without cognitive deficit PD with MCI and PD with dementia to that of healthy controls HC and investigate the correlation of such activity with NPTs. * Corresponding author.

Material and methods .. Patient selection and clinical assessment Fifty-five  idiopathic  PD  patients  and    HC  were  included  in  the study. The participants were examined by a neurologist specialising in movement disorders N.H.Y.. The diagnosis of PD was determined ac-cording  to  the  criteria of  the  United  Kingdom  PD  Society  Brain Bank . The HoehnYahr scale was used to detect the disease stage. Pa-tients who had a history of head trauma stroke or epilepsy and those with  vertical  gaze  paralysis  and  pyramidal  or  cerebellar  neurological findings were excluded from the study. All PD patients and HC under-went behavioural and neuropsychometric tests. The  control  group  included  healthy  participants  matched  for  age gender  and  education  level.  All  had  normal  neurologic  findings  and were  free  of  cognitive  impairment.  Approval  of  the  ethics  committee was obtained and all participants signed an informed consent. .. Behavioural and neuropsychometric evaluation The Standardized Mini-Mental Test SMMT  Verbal Learning Memory Test VLMT-teaching and long term  visual subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale WMS-momentary and long-term recall  Stroop ColorWord Test  Categorical Verbal Fluency Test CVFT fruit human animal counting  and Turkish versions of the Benton Face Recognition Test BFR and Benton Line Judgment Orientation Test BLOT  were administered to all participants. PDMCI was diagnosed according to the criteria proposed by Litvan et al.  for PD dementia the criteria determined by Emre et al.  were used. The staging of dementia was conducted using the Clinical Dementia  Rating  Scale  CDR  .  The  HC  group  was  composed  of participants with clinically normal cognition all SMMT scores of the HC group were  . The patients were separated into four groups according to the NPT results  healthy  controls  HC  PD  patients  with  normal  cognition PDNC PD patients with MCI PDMCI and PD patients with dementia PDD. .. Procedure ... EEG recording EEG was recorded for all participants in an electrically isolated and dimly  lit  room  at  the  Istanbul  Medipol  University  Hospital  REMER Clinical  Electrophysiology  Neuroimaging  and  Neuromodulation  Lab-oratory.  The  recordings  were  done  with  patients  in  the  on  stage  min after the morning dose of levodopa. EEG was recorded from  AgAgCl electrodes attached to an elastic cap Easy Cap according to the International  system. The EEG was amplified with a Brain Amp -channel DC system with band limits of . Hz and digitised online at a  Hz sampling rate. Two  linked  earlobe  electrodes  A  A  served  as  references.  All electrode impedances were kept below  K ohm. EOG was registered from the horizontal and vertical orbital rims of the right eye. ... EEG analysis Spontaneous  EEG  eyes-open  and  -closed  power  spectrum  analysis was performed in all participants. EEG data were pre-treated and EEG analysis  was  performed  using  Brain  Vision  Analyzer    Software  to analyse data from the F F C C T T TP TP P P O and O electrodes. Before analysis EEG artifacts were manually removed offline and EEG and EOG recordings were studied visually. The EEG data were segmented into eyes-open and eyes-closed data. Each section of the EEG data was divided into -ms segments. The epochs  containing  trials  with  muscle  artifacts  eye  movements  or blinking and blink artifacts were rejected. A notch filter of  Hz i.e. for  city  network  noise  was  applied  to  the  EEG  data.  Power  spectral analysis was performed by fast Fourier transform FFT in -s epochs. The power values were averaged across the epochs of an individual trial. After the application of FFT EEG was digitally filtered in  Hz band limits  for  analysis  of  alpha  activity.  The  maximum  alpha  frequency value  for  each  electrode  was  used  as  the  maximum  individual  alpha frequency  value  for  statistical  analysis  i.e.  the  numerical  values  for eyes  closed  and  open  were  included  separately.  The  absolute  alpha power was calculated. . Statistics .. ANOVA analysis using SPSS software Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics  and Statistica Software. Eyes-closed and eyes-open alpha power comparisons between groups were conducted using repeated-measures ANOVA.

Analysis of the alpha activity of PD patients according to cognitive level According to the results of our study the alpha activity amplitude in the bilateral parietal and occipital locations was low in all patient groups compared to the controls. One striking result was the lower amplitude in the  anterior  parts  of  each  hemisphere  lower  in  the  parietal  than  the occipital area and lower in the anterior portions of the parietal region. The  alpha  amplitude  in  the  parietal  and  occipital  regions  was  higher when the eyes were closed in HC and PDNC patients. The amplitudes did not differ between eyes open and closed in PDMCI and PDD patients. Global cognitive status is known to affect alpha activity decreases . Low alpha band amplitude was found in the PDMCI and PDD pa-tient groups . Furthermore in a -year follow-up study there was a further decrease in alpha band strength in the group that progressed to PDD  from  PDMCI  .  Babiloni  et  al.  observed  a  decrease  in  alpha activity  particularly  in  the  parietal  and  occipital  regions  in  PDMCI patients similar to our study . .. Alpha activity and NPT correlations The  relationship  between  quantitative  EEG  QEEG  findings  and cognitive test scores is not clear. In a study conducted with PD patients without dementia slowing of EEG activity was found not to be associ-ated with executive function verbal fluency episodic memory visuo-spatial tests or working memory . SMMT is a routine test used to screen for dementia  but is not sufficient  to  thoroughly  evaluate  patients  cognitive  functioning  so additional  NPTs  are  required  .  In  our  study  SMMT  scores  were correlated  with  alpha  activity  in  the  parietal  temporal  and  occipital locations  among  PDNC  PDMCI  and  PDD  patients.  The  amplitude  of alpha activity decreased as SMMT scores decreased. In a study by Morita et al. widespread slowing in the frontal central parietal and occipital regions was correlated with low scores on the SMMT . In a study by Gner et al. although a global deceleration in alpha activity was mainly observed in patients whose SMMT scores were   low EEG amplitude was  moderately  correlated  with  SMMT  scores  .  Babiloni  et  al. showed that low posterior temporal parietal and occipital alpha ac-tivity was associated with SMMT . PD comprises deficits in recall recognition and prospective mem-ory  all  of  which  deteriorate  with  disease  progression  .  Verbal memory deficits appear to suggest parietal and temporal dysfunction in PD patients without dementia . These changes in verbal memory in PD have been thought to be associated with hippocampal atrophy . In functional MRI studies a deficit in verbal recognition was associated with activity in parts of the anterior cingulate and inferior orbitofrontal cortex . In our research verbal memory tests were correlated with spontaneous  alpha  activity  in  the  parietal  region  in  PDMCI  and  in NeuroscienceLetters\\x0cN.H. Ylmaz et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              parietooccipital areas in PDD. Alpha power increased as the test scores increased. Based on these results we consider that verbal deficits which reflect complex functions develop due not only to impairment in one anatomical location but also to connection deficits between cortical and subcortical structures. The functional impairments between prefrontal parietal  temporal  thalamic  and  basal  ganglia  structures  become evident as the disease progresses. These impairments may explain the correlation between the verbal memory deficit and low alpha activity in PD. The visuospatial function comprises visual perception construction and visual memory. Visuospatial impairment is seen at every stage of PD . Conversion to dementia is high in PDMCI and visuospatial deficits detected in NPTs are a predictor of the progression to dementia . Visuospatial functions are also impaired in patients with PDNC with low parietal  EEG  activity  .  In  a  previous  study  although  visuospatial functions  were  affected  in  PD  cases  that  progressed  to  dementia  the reduction in the parietal alphatheta ratio was more striking . There was no correlation between visual memory tests and alpha activity in the PDNC  group  in  the  present  study.  However  there  was  a  correlation between the visual memory tests and alpha activity in the right parietal region in the PDMCI group and in the bilateral parietooccipital area in the  dementia  group.  The  factors  that  lead  to  these  results  may  be explained by the mechanisms that lead to visuospatial dysfunction. Vi-suospatial dysfunction in PD develops mainly from the basal ganglia-thalamocortical  pathway  particularly  the  dorsolateral  prefrontal  and posterior  parietal  cortex  .  In  voxel-based  studies  visuospatial dysfunction in PD patients was correlated with a reduction in posterior temporal and parietal grey matter density . Cortical thinning was evident in the posterior cerebral regions temporal parietal occipital of PDMCI patients compared to subjects with normal cognition . In our study although changes in alpha activity were closely correlated with visual memory the scores on other tests of visuospatial functioning BFR and BLOT tests were not associated with low alpha activity. However the  scores  decreased  significantly  as  cognitive  impairment  increased. The  correlation  between  QEEG  and  NPT  is  more  complicated  than suggested. Verbal  fluency  tests  evaluate  both  executive  and  verbal  functions  furthermore these are sensitive screening tests for assessment of executive dysfunction in PD . Executive dysfunction in PD may be explained  by  impairment  in  the  frontostriatal  pathway  .  In  our study  although  verbal  fluency  was  impaired  in  PDMCI  and  PDD  no correlation was found between the verbal fluency tests and EEG findings in PDMCI. Additionally our results showed a correlation between verbal fluency  tests  and  bilateral  parietooccipital  alpha  activity  in  the  PDD group. This result may be related to the association of alpha activity with frontobasal  gangliathalamus  connections  and  posterior  cerebral structures. In our study we showed that sites showing low alpha activity were more affected by the severity of cognitive deficit suggesting that this condition may be associated with the location of alpha-synuclein shown in the staging of Braak et al. . Cortical Lewy bodies are known to spread to the cortex in stages  and  . It is generally considered that cortical involvement is initially located toward the frontoparietal region and then moves toward the temporal cortex. In our study the amplitude reduction in parietal and occipital alpha activity in the posterior areas was  associated  with  cognitive  rather  than  frontal  alpha  activity  ac-cording to the results obtained from QEEG. It is difficult to detect the anatomical and pathophysiological loca-tions of cognitive deficits in PD. The diversity of PD patients method-ological  differences  among  studies  and  broad  range  and  overlapping nature of domains covered by cognitive tests contribute to this difficulty. This research is a pioneering study due to the detailed EEG correlations and subgroupings of NPT instruments addressing cognitive impairment in PD. The progression from normal cognition to dementia in PD can be monitored  not  only  by  objective  tests  such  as  the  SMMT and  various in verbal  and  visual  memory  tests  but  also  by  the  decline parietooccipital alpha activity amplitude. Low alpha activity amplitude on  EEG  may  be  a  leading  finding  for  the  development  of  dementia detectable long before NPT results are informative. Levodopa  can  cause  a  reduction  in  alpha  activity  in  PD  patients under dopaminergic treatment . The possible effects of levodopa on alpha amplitude the small number of patients the lack of classification by PD subtypes and the absence of functional imaging data to supple-ment QEEG are limitations of our study. . Conclusions We obtained results that could shed light on the relationship between NPTs and cortical alpha activity. Although SMMT scores were correlated with alpha activity at multiple locations at every stage of the disease verbal memory tests and visual memory tests were correlated with alpha activity in the parietal region in PDMCI and the parietooccipital area in PDD. The effect of PD on executive function was associated with alpha activity in the posterior cerebral cortex in PDD patients only. In previous studies QEEG was identified as a biomarker for diagnosis and follow-up of non-motor symptoms in PD . As seen in the present research  analysis  of  alpha  activity  provides  clinicians  with  another perspective  regarding  which  cognitive  domain  is  affected  and  which might  be  affected  with  increasing  cognitive  dysfunction  one  of  the non-motor symptoms of PD. Further studies are required to investigate this issue.

These symptoms as well as the effect of dopamine may be explained by distinct alterations inwhole-brain architecture. We used functional connectivity FC and in particular resting state network RSNanalysis to identify such whole-brain alterations in a frequency-specific manner. In addition we hypothesizedthat standard dopaminergic medication would have a normalizing effect on these whole brain alterations. Werecorded resting-state EEGs of  PD patients in the medical OFF and ON states and of  healthy age-matchedcontrols. The PD patients were either of akinetic-rigid or mixed subtype. We extracted RSNs with independentcomponent analysis in the source space for five frequency bands. Within the sensorimotor network SMN thesupplementary motor area SMA showed decreased FC in the OFF state compared to healthy controls. Thisfinding was reversed after dopamine administration. Furthermore in the OFF state no stable SMN beta com-ponent could be identified. The default mode network showed alterations due to PD independent of the medi-cation state. The visual network was altered in the OFF state and reinstated to a pattern similar to healthycontrols by medication. In conclusion PD causes distinct RSN alterations which are partly reversed after le-vodopa administration. The changes within the SMN are of particular interest because they broaden the pa-thophysiological understanding of PD. Our results identify the SMA as a central network hub affected in PD and acrucial effector of dopamine therapy.. IntroductionUnderstanding a complex disease like Parkinsons disease PD re-quires investigating whole-brain alterations. A promising recent ap-proach is studying the brain at rest i.e. without a specific task becauseit offers insights into the large-scale functional organization of thewhole brain. By now it is well known that brain activity at rest sepa-rates into resting state networks RSN. Because the RSN involve mul-tiple brain structures with distinct functional roles alterations visible inthe RSN might potentially explain a variety of clinical features in PD.Motor symptoms in PD are commonly ascribed to pathological oscil-lations in beta and tremor-frequency ranges. At the same time treat-ment of motor symptoms with levodopa is thought to restore such os-cillations to a normal level. The relevance of oscillations makes afrequency-specific electrophysiological network approach a promisingresearch avenue. The goal of the present study was therefore twofoldinvestigating frequency-specific pathological network alterations in PDand analyzing the effects of dopaminergic medication on these networkalterations.For PD pathological beta hypersynchronization has been identifiedwithin the subthalamic nucleus STN and between the STN and motorcortex of PD patients Hirschmann et al.  Hirschmann et al. Khn et al.  Neumann et al.  Oswal et al. Tinkhauser et al.  Weinberger et al. . These beta oscilla-tions were suppressed either by dopamine Hirschmann et al. Neumann et al.  Tinkhauser et al.  or deep brain stimula-tion DBS Abbasi et al.  Khn et al.  Oswal et al. which are used as therapeutic means in PD. This suggests that betaoscillations are pathological. Based on these findings we hypothesizedthat in particular alterations in the beta frequency range are present inthe motor-network and that those alterations are reduced through do-pamine.

Schneider et al.NeuroImage Clinical   contrasting PD patients with healthy control subjects promises furthervaluable insight into altered brain networks and non-motor symptomsof PD.To investigate non-motor symptoms most previous studies have sofar relied on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI. Graphanalysis on fMRI data revealed nodal and global efficiency decreases inPD patients compared to healthy controls Skidmore et al.  anddistinct changes in the connectivity pattern in multiple brain regions ofPD patients involving both motor and non-motor regions Skidmoreet al. . PD and drug-induced Parkinsonism exhibit a differentresting state functional connectivity FC in fMRI which hints at con-nectivity changes specific to PD extending beyond the dopaminergicsystem Ham et al. . RSN alterations in PD patients were asso-ciated with deteriorating cognitive performance Baggio et al. . Newly diagnosed PD patients revealed alterations in multipleRSNs including the sensorimotor visual and default mode networkFang et al. . fMRI however does not provide any frequency-specific information. Longitudinal graph-theoretic approaches withMEG also found a link between frequency-specific RSN alterations anddeteriorating motor and cognitive performance Olde Dubbelink et al.a b. Therefore in the present study we aimed at extendingthese insights to frequency-specific RSN alterations. Since the mostwidely reported changes in fMRI RSN due to PD are within the sen-sorimotor visual and default mode network de Schipper et al. Fang et al.  Gttlich et al.  Pelzer et al.  we focusedour analysis on these  networks. This choice is also advocated by theclinical symptoms because PD often triggers cognitive deteriorationand visual hallucinations besides classic motor symptoms.The PD patients in most previous studies were either studied ON orOFF medication preventing a direct investigation of medication effects.In a combined fMRI and PET approach dopamine levels modulated FCpatterns in PD Baik et al. . Moreover there is evidence fromresting state analysis pointing towards a specific local effect of levodopaadministration on the supplementary motor area SMA which wasgenerally suppressed in PD Casarotto et al.  Esposito et al. Skidmore et al.  Wu et al. . Even though levedopa medi-cation is still considered the standard therapy for PD there remainsubstantial therapeutic limitations due to side effects resulting both inmotor and non-motor symptoms Fahn  You et al. . Thus abetter understanding of levodopa effects on global brain properties isinstrumental for improving pharmacologic therapy of PD in the future.In the present study we recorded high-density EEG of patients ONand OFF medication as well as a healthy control group. From these datawe extracted the resting state networks at the source level with anapproach adapted from Brookes et al. . This approach improvesupon previous electrophysiological studies of PD by not confining theanalysis to predefined regions of interest. This is particularly importantas frequency-specific network alterations in PD are not yet sufficientlyunderstood to define such regions of interest ROI with confidence.Moreover defining seed regions always implies a certain amount ofsubjectivity. In contrast our approach allows whole-brain networkextraction without potentially confounding the data analysis by priordefinition of an ROI. Using this approach we aimed at identifyingwhole-brain network alterations in Parkinsons disease and the effect ofstandard dopaminergic medication. Based on the previous literature weexpected i alterations in the motor-network of Parkinson patients inthe beta frequency range and ii a mitigating effect of dopamine onthose alterations. Furthermore we hypothesized that dopamine gen-erally restores RSN properties of PD patients to a more physiologicalpattern.. Materials and methods..

Toclassify a patient as akinetic-rigid a patients non-tremor score had to beat least twice the tremor score. Otherwise patients were categorized asmixed type... Data acquisitionAll participants were told to sit relaxed in our EEG chamber and tofixate on a cross. EEG measurement was performed with a  EEG-channel actiCAP sampling rate at . kHz. The so-called activeelectrodes amplify the signal to increase the signal-to-noise ratioSNR. We aimed at impedances   kOhm. Eye movements andcardiac activity were recorded simultaneously with vertical electro-oculography EOG and electrocardiography ECG. Electrode positionswere digitized using a Zebris ultrasound device. During the actual EEGrecordings we made sure all subjects stayed awake by monitoring themwith a camera system. We measured the control participants for  mineach split in  min blocks. To make sure PD patients were in clinicalmedication OFF all PD medication had to be paused for at least  hprior to the EEG measurement. Before sitting in the scanner an ex-perienced motor disorder specialist assessed the individual UPDRS IIImotor score for each patient in the OFF state. We then recorded \\x0cL.

With this approach we were able to identify whole brainnetworks without the inherent subjectivity or potential bias due todefining regions of interest prior to network extraction. Importantlywithin the healthy control group we were able to extract stable restingstate networks as known from the fMRI literature. For unmedicated PDpatients the FC within the SMN to the SMA was suppressed in thegamma band. This effect was reversed after levodopa administration.These findings extend our pathophysiological understanding of PDespecially in terms of an altered motor network structure and itsreinstatement after dopamine intake... EEG resting state networks in healthy elderly subjectsFor the control subjects we could extract stable components fromvarious frequency bands for well-established resting state networksincluding the SMN the DMN and the visual network. These networkswere spatially matched with networks described in the fMRI literature.This confirms that the resting state analysis works for EEG data. TheSMN of the elderly healthy controls was found in alpha beta andgamma frequencies which isin line with previous findingsNugent et al.  Sockeel et al. . Best spatially matched wasthe gamma component. The main SMN component did not span bothhemispheres equally but was split into two components see Fig. b.Previously the SMN has been reported to be dominated by beta oscil-lations Brookes et al.  Mantini et al. . However thesestudies investigated the RSNs of younger healthy subjects. To ourknowledge the only study investigating older healthy participantsmean age  years reports both beta and gamma frequencies for theSMN Hillebrand et al. . Another group scanned participants aged to  years with EEG and reports a spatial cross-frequency organi-zation of the SMN with beta and gamma components Aoki et al.. Even though the aforementioned electrophysiological studiesinvestigated heterogeneous age groups they provide evidence thathealthy aging might contribute to network reorganization and thus alsofrequency alterations in particular in motor networks.Supporting evidence of this conjecture comes from fMRI results thatconvincingly indicate that aging specifically affects the sensorimotornetwork. For example a complex pattern of FC increases and decreaseswith aging affecting cortical and cerebellar motor networks has beendescribed by Seidler et al. . Another fMRI study reported in-creased FC from the sensorimotor cortex of healthy elderly and reducedFC from the mid-posterior insula. Moreover age could be predicted bythis reduced FC strongly indicating a physiological re-organization ofthe SMN with aging He et al. . In contrast electrophysiologicalfindings on aging effects are more challenging to interpret. Asymme-trical spectral power alterations were reported from the motor cortexwith increased beta and gamma band activity in both hemispheresCottone et al. . Brain networks of healthy adults increase in sizewith aging in beta and gamma frequencies Schlee et al. . This isanother hint at alterations especially in beta and gamma frequenciesand suggest that further research on electrophysiological correlates ofhealthy aging might be fruitful... PatientsThe SMN in the gamma frequency range of the unmedicated pa-tients exhibited a significant decrease in frontal areas including theSMA whereas it was enlarged in posterior regions when compared withhealthy controls and patients ON medication p.. There were nosignificant spatial differences between healthy controls and patients ONmedication for the SMA. Our results therefore provide evidence for animpaired SMN for PD patients at rest particularly in the SMA at gammafrequencies which is reinstated after levodopa treatment.Electrophysiological findings on medication effects within the SMATable Sensorimotor network Independent t-tests for significant inter-group differences of best-fitting components and within frequency bands p.. *no stable SMNcomponent for patients OFF medication therefore no comparison to controls and patients ON medication possible.Inter-group comparisonBeta bandGamma bandON vs. OFFControls vs. ONNo significant differencesON increased posterior properties-*no significant differencesControls vs. OFFOFF increased posterior propertiesdecreased SMA-*OFF SMA decreased increased posterior network propertiesspatial network properties very similar only minor increase in the rightinterhemispheric fissureOFF SMA decreased increased posterior network properties\\x0cL.

One study reported an over-activation for the SMA of PD pa-tients versus healthy controls at gamma frequencies Moazami-Goudarzi et al. . However this study combined patients with andwithout levodopa intake which somewhat complicates insights intopossible levodopa effects. Nonetheless it hints at a crucial role ofgamma oscillations within the SMA of PD patients. Moreover PD pa-tients have altered motor loops including the SMA both during in-ternally and externally paced repetitive finger movements Herz et al.a Herz et al. . Levodopa was shown to reinstate morephysiological connectivity patterns in these loops particularly in highbeta and gamma frequencies. Recently levodopa intake was shown toreduce beta-band desynchronization in the SMA during a motor taskfurther pointing to a pivotal role of the SMA in pathological networkorganization in PD patients and as a possible effector of levodopatreatment Chung et al. .The effects of levodopa treatment have been investigated in moredetail with fMRI The first fMRI study to investigate FC within themotor network of PD patients found decreases in the SMA for patientsOFF medication and normalizations after  mg levodopa intake.Importantly all patients received a standard dosage rather than do-sages based on their individual anti-Parkinsonian medication Wu et al.. These findings are in line with another fMRI study investigatingthe amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ALFF as a marker of brainactivity during rest Skidmore et al. . ALFF signals in the SMAwere lower in patients OFF medication than in healthy controls. Sup-pressed FC within the SMA was reported when comparing controls anduntreated PD patients Esposito et al. . Furthermore levodopaincreased FC especially in the SMA of PD patients both versus healthycontrols and a placebo group. Recently it has been shown with tran-scranial magnetic stimulation TMS and EEG that levodopa intake in-creases the excitability nearby the SMA Casarotto et al. . Theseresults likewise suggest a disengagement especially of the SMA in PDthat is reversed by levodopa administration possibly through locallyrestoring a more physiological network mechanism.Taken together our study provides further evidence for the hy-pothesis that the SMA is a central hub for the patho-mechanism of PDand for levodopa effects at rest... SMN in the beta rangeInterestingly we did not find a beta SMN component for the pa-tients OFF medication suggesting a disrupted network architecture ofthe whole SMN particularly in beta frequencies. In contrast after le-vodopa administration we found a stable SMN component in the beta\\x0cL. Schneider et al.NeuroImage Clinical   Fig. .

Thevalues plotted correspond to the correlation value between IC component and the envelope time-series.band of PD patients. Moreover there were only minor significant dif-ferences between controls and PD patients ON medication in the betaband. Our findings therefore suggest that the SMN is suppressed in theOFF state notably in beta frequencies. Levodopa seemingly restores theSMN to a spatial pattern almost identical to healthy controls and ef-fectively improves motor function.Beta oscillations have been identified to play an essential role withinthe motor cortex. They aid post-movement motor inhibition in healthycontrols and are desynchronized during movementHeinrichs-Graham et al. . Furthermore the SMN from healthy subjects isdominated by beta oscillations Hillebrand et al.  Mantini et al.. Therefore one might speculate that an impaired SMN at betafrequencies crucially contributes to motor symptoms of PD patients.A potential explanation might be based on pathological beta hyper-synchronization within the Subthalamic Nucleus STN and betweenthe STN and motor cortices which has been reported by numerousstudies Hirschmann et al.  Hirschmann et al.  Khn et al. Neumann et al.  Tinkhauser et al.  Weinberger et al.. At first glance a state of hyper-synchronization seems to implyincreased resting state connectivity and thus potentially a stronger betacomponent for the SMN. This would contradict our results. But there isevidence from a MEG study reconciling these two conflicting findings.Beta oscillations of PD patients OFF medication were actually decreasedduring restin the motor cortex compared to healthy controlsHeinrichs-Graham et al. . Furthermore they were restored afterdopamine administration thus a normalizing effect was hypothesizedwhich is in line with our results. Interestingly the aforementionedstudy also reported a beta hypersynchrony between left and right motorcortices in the unmedicated patients which was reduced after levodopaadministration. This finding might provide a connecting link betweenpathological beta-hypersynchrony on the one hand and reduced FCwithin motor areas during resting state on the other hand.Selection bias might pose another challenge at interpreting theprevious literature on pathological beta oscillations from PD. Theelectrophysiological activity of the STN is only detectable through deepbrain stimulation DBS electrodes. The reported pathological findingsfrom the STN usually are from severely affected patients with a longdisease duration. The patients in our study had an average diseaseduration of  years and had no DBS electrodes implanted making adirect linking to the STN activity infeasible. Such a direct comparisonlinking resting state activity from deep-brain structures and corticalnetworks would require a whole-brain investigation... Default mode networkThe DMN was seemingly split into the bifrontal medial cortex and\\x0cL. Schneider et al.NeuroImage Clinical   left and right inferior parietal cortex components. We concentrated onthe bifrontal components Kahnt and Tobler  Nieuwenhuys et al.. For the healthy elderly it was found in theta frequencies. Thiscontrasts with previous MEG findings which extracted it from alphafrequencies Brookes et al. . Interestingly this study did not finda PCC component either. They speculated that due to the relatively lowspatial resolution of MEG for deeper brain regions they did not identifythe PCC. The same logic should apply to our EEG results. Another studyfound the DMN best correlated to alpha and beta oscillationsMantini et al. . However when participants were instructed toalternate between self-referencing and concentrating on breathing theDMN was determined in the theta band Fomina et al. . Si-multaneous electrocorticographic and fMRI recordings from epilepsypatients revealed a spatial correspondence for the DMN in the thetaband Hacker et al. . Taken together these findings suggest awidely distributed frequency pattern for the DMN.Interestingly we found the DMN in the beta band for patients bothON and OFF medication. This suggests an effect on the DMN that goesbeyond the effects of pure dopamine depletion. Akinetic-rigid PD pa-tients have a disrupted DMN architecture even in a state of normalcognitive function and gray matter volume Hou et al. . Ourpatient cohort consisted of akinetic-rigid and mixed-type patientswithout cognitive deficits. Thus our findings in the DMN are in linewith the fore-cited study. The akinetic-rigid subtype in particular isassociated with faster cognitive decline compared to tremor-dominantpatients Thenganatt and Jankovic . Alterations in the DMNstructure might therefore provide a valuable link to cognitive dete-rioration even in early sub-clinical stages... Visual networkWe found the best-fitting components for the visual network of thehealthy elderly within the delta band. Within the OFF medication groupit was located in the alpha band whereas it changed back to the deltaband ON medication. These findings suggest an altered frequency patternin the visual network in PD as well as a normalizing effect of levodopa.Our findings are in line with previous work reporting a wide rangeof alterations in visual networks from fMRI data. Newly diagnosed PDpatients with medication history of less than a week revealed disrup-tions in visual networks using graph theoretical analysis Fang et al.. Studying PD patients with and without visual hallucinationsrevealed a reduced FC in the occipital lobe for both groups versushealthy controls Hepp et al. . De Schipper et al.  studiedboth standard fMRI RSNs and eigenvector centrality mapping EC inPD patients. Contrary to the aforementioned study an increased FC inoccipital regions within the PD patient group was described. Contrast-ingly EC was reduced. Gttlich et al.  report decreased interactionof the visual network with other brain areas for PD patients. This sug-gests that changes in the visual network are part of a broader pattern ofbrain alterations in PD... Methodological considerationsFinally we would like to highlight three methodological con-siderations of our study.asclassifiedFirst our patient cohort consisted of akinetic-rigid and mixed-typePD subtypes with advanced disease stages. No tremor-dominant pa-tientsonSpiegel et al.  were included. Different PD subtypes have beenshown to exhibit different metabolic and longitudinal characteristicsEggers et al.   . Therefore one should be carefulwhen applying our findings to PD patients in general.their UPDRSsub-scoresbasedbySecond EEG has a high temporal resolution but somewhat lacksspatial resolution. However RSNs span large portions of the brain.Therefore the lack of spatial resolution does not result in major implica-tions for the extraction of robust networks. By solving the inverse problemprior to further analysis we could extract the RSNs based on the corticalmap. This considerably improves the interpretability of our results.Third the choice of the number of ICs is always slightly arbitrary.Brookes et al.  used  ICs for MEG data. However for our EEGdata with its lower number of channels it was not possible to obtain stable ICs for all frequency bands. Therefore we reduced the number ofICs to . These  ICs still allowed us to extract the  networks that weinvestigated in detail in the present study.. ConclusionThe present study was designed to identify electrophysiological RSNalterations due to PD within distinct frequency bands. We hypothesizeddopamine would reinstate the network structure of PD patients pos-sibly through providing an alternative rather than an identical networkcomposition. Indeed the SMN for the PD patients OFF medication isaffected at rest particularly through a reduced FC of the SMA at gammafrequencies. This effect is reversed after levodopa intake. These findingsemphasize the role of the SMA both as a central network hub in thepathophysiology of PD and a potential target of levodopa treatment.Additionally the SMN in the beta band is missing in the OFF medica-tion state and is reinstated after levodopa intake. This further highlightsthe importance of beta band alterations in PD within integral parts ofthe motor network. We therefore suggest that the reintegration ofmotor networks in the beta band is connected to the clinical motorimprovements after levodopa treatment. Changes in DMN were foundsomewhat independently from levodopa. This could be related to earlycognitive decline. Taken together in the present study alterations in theRSN architecture provided insights into pathophysiologic processeswhich might be involved in distinct clinical features of PD. This link toclinical symptoms is worth further exploration.CRediT authorship contribution statementLukasSchneideradministrationVisualizationMethodology Formal analysis Data curation Writing - original draft.Valentin Seeger Formal analysis Data curation Writing - review editing.

More specially environ-mental concerns peaked after the critical carbon dioxide level exceeded. Increasing the percentage of clean andrenewable energy sources while compensating energy demand became mandatory than ever before. At thatpoint alcohols are attractive alternative fuels to gasoline and diesel especially in terms of harmful exhaustemissions. The effects of the typical alcohols such as ethanol methanol butanol etc. were examined in detail upto date. Fusel oil is a higher alcohol obtained during the fermentation process as a byproduct and its usage ininternal combustion engines took attention during the last decade. In this study a comprehensive review wasconducted about the potential usage of the fusel oil in internal combustion engines as a renewable and cleanenergy source. The potential production of the fusel oil and its properties as a fuel were discussed. The engineperformance combustion and emission characteristics of the fusel oil on spark ignition compression ignitionand homogeneous charge compression ignition engines were also examined in detail. The findings indicated thatthe performance characteristics of fusel oil are similar o ethanol which may increase the application area of it.. IntroductionFossil-based petroleum fuels are the main energy sources for a widerange of sectors especially transportation . The chemical energyof the fossil fuels is released after the oxidation process which requires acertain airfuel ratio. If the stoichiometric combustion conditions canbe provided exhaust products are acceptable except carbon dioxideCO. It is well known that theoretical stoichiometric combustion is notpossible for an internal combustion engine even for an atmosphericburner . For an internal combustion engine it is very hard toprovide proper mixture enough time and homogeneous temperaturedistribution in the cylinder. The maximum combustion efficiency isgenerally less than  for both spark ignition and compressionignition engines. Therefore incomplete combustion products carbonmonoxide CO and unburned hydrocarbon UHC emissions are in-evitable. Considering also nitrogen oxide NOx and CO emissions theextent of the damage caused by exhaust gases to the environment isobvious . Among these harmful gases as a greenhouse gas COis the main responsible for climate change and atmospheric CO levelhas passed over the critical  ppm limit in . This has led toincreased environmental concerns .Searching renewable and environmentally friendly fuel is going onfor decades because of both the harmful aspects of fossil fuels and de-pletion risks of it . Besides the studies on advanced vehicletechnologies such as hybrid electric vehicles fully electric vehicles fuelcell solar technologies etc. accelerated in the past  years .However most of those are still under the developing process and itdoes not seem to be possible to find a wide usage area in the short andmedium-term because of several issues. For this reason the power de-mand of the vehicles will be provided by internal combustion enginesfor a long time. That makes mandatory to use cleaner fuels in internalcombustion engine. Oxygenated fuels are the most popular alternativefuels because of their oxygen content that improves combustion in thecylinder and it allows to reduce emissions on the source .Corresponding author.E-mail addresses m.safieddinscu.ac.ir S.M.

Alcohol fuels which can beutilized as an oxygenated fuel in internal combustion engines arecurrently used energy sources for transportation especially for pas-senger cars. There is no doubt that ethanol has the largest percentage interms of usage in passenger vehicles among the other alcohol types. Itsnon-toxic structure and the abundant producibility capacity from bio-sources are the main reasons for wide application of it. Its high hy-drogencarbon ratio high research octane number high flame propa-gation speed low volatility emissions safe storage and transportationfeatures also make it a reliable fuel especially for spark-ignition en-gines .Fusel oil takes attention by researchers due to its ethanol like fea-tures. Fusel oil which has an oxygenated chemical structure is a by-product of the fermentation process and its research octane number isover  as like as ethanol . Therefore it seems to be an ap-propriate alternative fuel particularly for spark-ignition engines. Fuseloil is placed as an oily layer after removing the alcohol from the fer-mented mixtures including some amount of water. This secondary layerwas firstly named as fousel. The meaning of the fousel in German is theevil spirit. This name might have been given to fusel oil because of itsbad odor and dark brown color. In  Dumas conducted a study todetermine the boiling point of fusel oil obtained from fermented potato.He determined that the boiling point of the fusel oil is between  and C . Up to date fusel oil was mostly used to produce isoamylacetate biodiesel bio-lubricants . There are a few applicationsusing it as an energy source in distilleries as well . There is no studyabout the usage of the fusel oil in internal combustion engines until .The production of the fusel oil is possible by distillation of anyfermented mixture. Its structure varies due to the type of fermentedproduct. A typical fusel oil contains higher alcohols such as i-amyl al-cohol i-butanol i-propanol. It also contains some amount of ethanoland miscellaneous alcohols as well as moisture content . The fuseloil is a higher alcohol by considering its chemical structure. Higheralcohols which have a carbon number from  to  also have thepotential to be evaluated as fuel in internal combustion engines. At-manl  conducted a study examining the effects of higher alcoholssuch as propanol n-butanol and pentanol by blending dieselbiodiesel.It was reported that the higher alcohols improved the cold filter plug-ging point of the dieselbiodiesel blends. However higher alcoholsslightly reduced kinematic viscosity lower heating value density andcetane number. NOx emissions decreased while carbon monoxideemissions increased with the use of all three higher alcohols. en investigated the effect of injection pressure on a diesel engine poweredwith propanol-diesel fuel blends. Combustion duration shortened byusing propanol. Another butanol-diesel study was conducted by Sarikoet al . It was found that the butanol percentage affected energy-exergy values. The ternary blend of diesel-biodiesel-butanol was foundto be similar to petro-diesel in terms of energy-exergy efficiency.Fuel   brake thermal efficiencynitrogen oxidescarbon monoxidemethyl tert-butyl etherHomogeneous charge compression ignitioncompression ratioindicated thermal efficiency ethanol and  n-heptaneFBWE  pure gasoline   fusel oil after water removalBTENOXCOMTBEHCCICRITEEFAWE  pure gasoline   fusel oil before water removalFBWE  pure gasoline   fusel oil before water removalFGasolineMoreover emission levels of the ternary fuel blend was lower thaneurodiesel. Santhosh et al.  experimentally investigated the per-formance and emission characteristics of a common rail direct injectiondiesel engine using -pentanol and diesel fuel blends. Exhaust gas re-circulation was also utilized in the study. It was found that -pentanolnegatively affected brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuelconsumption while it reduced the NOx emissions. It was also reportedthat the ignition delay increased by using -pentanol and diesel fuelblends because of the lower cetane rating of the -pentanol. Uslu andelik  tested the isoamyl alcohol-gasoline fuel blends in a spark-ignition engine. The combustion and emission characteristics of theengine were investigated in use of isoamyl alcohol. It was reported thatisoamyl alcohol positively affected torque and brake thermal efficiencyand exhaust emissions. The improvement in engine performance wasexplained with the oxygenated structure and the higher latent heat ofisoamyl alcohol that enhance volumetric efficiency.As can be seen in the literature review higher alcohols can be usedboth in spark-ignition engines and compression ignition engines. Likethe other higher alcohols fusel oil has the potential to be used in bothtypes of those engines. Up to date several studies were performed byusing fusel oil in internal combustion engines. Fusel oil can be con-sidered as a new opportunity for internal combustion engines amongthe other higher alcohols because all of the studies about the usage ofthe fusel oil in internal combustion engines were conducted in the lastdecade. In this study a comprehensive review was performed aboutfusel oil potential as a new renewable energy source for internal com-bustion engines. The next sections of this paper explain the propertiesof fusel oil as a fuel the potential production of the fusel oil over theworld the results about the usage of fusel oil in both spark ignitioncompression ignition and homogeneous charge compression ignitionengines in terms of engine performance combustion and emissions.. Physical and chemical properties of fusel oil relevant to enginesThe advantages of using fusel oil CHO as a diesel additive havediscussed extensively. Fusel oil properties are dependent on differentparameters including the process of decantingdistillation the condi-tion during the fermentation process and more especially bio-basedmaterial used. The composition of fusel oil and its characteristics aredepicted in Table .Table Physical characteristics of fusel oil composition .ComponentformulavvDensity g.cmBoiling point CEthanolWatern-propyl alkyln-butyl alcoholi-butyl alcoholi-amyl alcoholCHOHOCHOCHOCHOCHO...............\\x0cS.M. Safieddin Ardebili et al.Fuel   Chemical and physical properties of fusel oil are the main para-meters in determining the quality of the blended fuel. Such propertiescould directly affect the combustion process and exhaust emissioncharacteristics of internal combustion engines. The main chemicalphysical properties of conventional fossil fuels i.e. diesel and gaso-line ethanol and fusel oil are presented in Table . . Thehigh oxygen contained in the fusel oil compared to that of gasoline anddiesel is beneficial for combustion quality. The presence of oxygenmolecules has beneficial consequences for its characteristics as a fueladditive. The oxygen content also leads to a low airfuel ratio re-quirement in comparison with diesel and gasoline fuel. A significantdisadvantage of the high oxygen content is that it obviously reduces theheating value . Besides fuse oil has a higher auto-ignition tem-perature and flashing point compared to both diesel and gasoline fuelthus using this fusel at high temperatures is safer.The main drawback of fusel oildiesel mixture is the miscibility offusel oil in neat diesel especially at low temperatures which in turnleads to incomplete combustion . This problem can be addressed byadding biodiesel in fusel oildiesel blends . According to Table  itwas clearly evident that fusel oil had a higher cetane number comparedto ethanol. Generally the high value of the cetane number of fuels tendsto enhance engine brake power and reduce NOX formation . Ac-cording to Table  fusel oil has advantages over ethanol due to itshigher cetane number. The low cetane number could lead to longerignition delay engine misfiring and higher average combustion tem-perature . Also fusel oil could be considered to have a positiveeffect on in-cylinder pressure and injection timing because of its higherviscosity in comparison with diesel and ethanol fuels . Fusel oilwould also be considered as a high-density fuel than ethanol. Thehigher density of fuel causes an increase in mass flow rate and a de-crease in fuel leakage during injection which consequently results inimproving the efficiency of the fuel . In addition the presence ofwater in fusel oil ranging from . to  would lead to a lowercombustion temperature and heat release rate which could conse-quently cause a remarkable NOx reduction .. Fusel oil production potential in the worldIn recent years alcohol-based fuels including ethanol  butanol and methanol  are conventional renewable fuels. Currentlyethanol is one of the most established alternatives to fossil orientedfuels in the US Brazil and even South Africa because of its renew-ability higher energy density and also less toxicity compared to me-thanol fuel . Nowadays bioethanol makes the main contribution togreen transport corresponding to  of the worlds energy con-sumption for the transport sector Global ethanol production increasedby by. in  compared to  . The United States andBrazil account for the worlds largest producers of ethanol accountingfor  of the global production. However the fermentation processemployed is totally different in each of these two countries . Thecharacteristics of bioethanol production in Brazil and the United Stateshave been depicted in Table .Currently a number of countries have announced an ethanol-ga-soline blend to expand the mandatory use of oxygenates fuel additiveby . For instance the government of China announced a programto promote biomass-based ethanol as a renewable fuel blended withgasoline at a ratio of  . As shown in Table  bioethanol isproduced by fermentation of different feedstock in various countries.The increasing rate in ethanol production has resulted in a con-siderable increase in fusel oil quantity as a byproduct and the con-sequent environmental impacts. It is estimated that one ton of rawsugar derived from sugarcanesugarbeet molasses would yield .L of ethanol . Also one ton of ethyl alcohol would produce . Lof fusel oil through the distillation process . According to theabove-mentioned conversion factor the total potential for fusel oilproduction in the world is estimated to be  million liters whichwould be equivalent to  million liter of gasoline and  millionliter of diesel fuel. Global fusel oil production by country from  to is given in Table . According to calculations fusel oil productionis very concentrated geographically. The United States produces morethan half of the worlds fusel oil . followed by Brazil ..Fusel oil production in European Union was stable in  at million litres. Fusel oil generation rose  from  to . Chinaranks fourth for fusel oil production globally during  andproduced around  million litres.Methyl tert-butyl ether MTBE has been used as a fuel additive fordecades. The increase in fossil fuel consumption has led to a significantincrease in the release of MTBE. MTBE as a toxic organic compoundrepresents a serious long-term environmental impact . To addressthis issue the fusel oil usage as a oxygenate additive is expected toincrease as a result of the phase-out of MTBE in some countries. Theusage of fusel oil in internal combustion engines is a promising alter-native to diversify and substitute fossil fusel partially without any en-gine modification in existing CI and SI engines . Nations withethanol blend mandates are primary fusel oil consumption in the worldFig.  . Therefore fusel oil can remarkably reduce the reliance onMTBE in those countries.. Methods of using fusel oil as an engine fuel.. Using fusel oil in spark ignition enginesFusel oil as a long-chain alcohol has attracted considerable interestdue to the positive effect on the engine performance and exhaustemissions. Fusel oil can be used in spark-ignition SI engines withoutany significant engine modification. Several investigations concerningthe application of fusel oil in SI engines have been performed espe-cially in the past ten years Table .... Engine performanceThe potential for increased engine brake powertorque fueled withfusel oil has been experimentally validated. ingr and Calam  wasthe first to report the effect of fusel oil on the engine performance. Theimprovement in the brake torque was obtained as  at all the testedengine speed i.e.  rpm. The maximum engine torque wasreported for a fusel oil blend of . Their results were later confirmedby Calam et al.  who reported higher engine brake torque com-pared to gasoline fuel when combusting F. A maximum engine braketorque .

Studying the impacts of different engine loadsspeeds when usingfusel oildiesel blends Calam et al.  reported engine torque hadincreased by  when F was used. More specifically they in-dicated that at a high level of fusel oil ratio the brake torque increasedcompared to the brake torque of the engine running with F.

Later in  contrary to the above-mentionedfindings Solmaz et al.  stated that the addition of fusel oil intogasoline led to an adverse effect on the engine torque. He reported thatthe combustion of the fusel oil blend of  and  led to  and decrease in engine torque. The lower LHV and water content offusel oil was highlighted as the main reasons for the decrease in enginetorque. in addition brake thermal efficiency BTE variations had asimilar trend and decreased  whit increasing fusel oil concentra-tion. The best BTE was obtained when the fusel oil ratio of  wasblended. More specifically the in-cylinder pressures and heat releaserates of F and F fuels were reportedly decreased while engineload was increased. He also pinpointed the decrease in IMEP and in-cylinder pressure as a result of the water content of fusel oil i.e.. As mentioned above the impacts of water content of fusel oilon the combustion characteristic and engine performance have beenfrequently reported to be negative. In order to improve the quality offusel oil in a different study Awad et al.  investigated the effect ofmoisture content removal from fusel oil on the calorific value CV ofthe blended fuels. They reported that when the water content of fuseloil has decreased from . to . some improvements in CV brakepower and BTE could be observed. Both IMEP and the rate of in-cy-linder pressure rise increased after the reduction of water content to. Meanwhile for fusel oilgasoline blends combustion durationwas observed shorter than that of gasoline. They also found that thedecrease of the water percentage in the fuel blends has led to a slightimprovement in engine power up to . compared to the fuel blendsbefore water removal . Later in an experimental work on fusel oilgasoline mixture Awad et al.  also confirmed the previous ob-servations. They employed multi-objective optimization based on theresponse surface method RSM to estimate the optimal value of engineperformance parameters and exhaust emission characteristics fueledwith different fusel oilgasoline blends. The optimal values of engineworking conditions were found to be an engine speed of  rpm fuseloil concentration of  and . of throttle position. They highlightthat water removal from fusel oil blends had a positive effect on BTEbrake torque and brake power. In a different study Awad et al. blended different water content of fusel oil in gasoline fusel. The testswere performed at constant engine load  and different enginespeeds. Similar findings i.e. an improvement in the combustion andengine performance characteristics were achieved. They indicated thatthe FAWE had a better combustion as a result of lower CA. In aninteresting study the effects of extraction of water on the fusel oilgasoline mixture characteristics was investigated by Awad et al. .They claimed that the studied emulsion led to an improved BTE andbrake power. Also the reduction of the water content enhanced thecombustion temperature and performance because of complete com-bustion of fuel blend compared to pure gasoline . Simsek and Oz-dalyan  in the year  investigated the effect of five fusel oilgasoline blends at various engine loads and fixed engine speed on theengine performance and exhaust emissions. They found that F ap-peared to have higher BTE . and brake torque . valuescompared to neat gasoline. However a decrease in BTE and enginetoque was observed at high levels of fusel oil and pure diesel blends i.e. and .Very recently Safieddin et al.  focused on the effectof addition of different fusel oil gasoline mixture    and at different engine load levels     and in a single-cylinder four-stroke engine. RSM was used to optimize en-gine performance and exhaust emissions. Their finding showed that theaddition of fusel oil into pure gasoline led to decrease in BTE and braketorque by  and  respectively due to lower combustion tem-perature in the cylinder as shown in Fig. .... Fuel consumptionVariations in fuel consumption as a result of fusel oil mixing intopure gasoline has been studied by several investigations. In almost allthe previous works the effect of adding fusel oil to gasoline has beenreported to be negative for BSFC mainly due to a decrease in the CV ofthe fuel blends. For example Icingur and Calam  observed that thespecific fuel consumption SFC increased with increasing fusel oilpercentage in the fuel mixtures for all engine speeds. Specific fuelconsumption increased by up to . using fusel oil blend of compared to mineral gasoline . The same trend was also observedby Calam et al. . Solmaz  extended the latter work by testingF F and F separately. He reported that BSFC for all fuel blendswas considerably higher than that of gasoline because of the combinedeffect of high density and lower heating value LHV of fusel oil. Simsekand Ozdalyan  and Awad et al.  both indicated that  fuseloil blended into gasoline fuel led to increased BSFC. AdditionallySimsek and Ozdalyan  reported a significant enhancement in SFC asthe amount of fusel in the fusel oil-diesel emulsion increased. The in-creased BSFC of . . and . were reported when usingF F and F respectively. Similar to the other studies the gain inBSFC was attributed to the lower heating value of fusel oil. In contrastto the above experimental works Safieddin Ardebili et al  reportedthat by increasing the amount of fusel oil included into gasoline up to BSFC decreased by . However they measured a  increasein BSFC when fusel oil content increased from  to . Generallyit could be concluded that the addition of fusel oil into gasoline wouldresult in an increase in BSFC at various engine loadsspeeds.... Exhaust emissions.... NOX emissions.

Geographical distribution of major fusel oil end-users.fuel has a negative affect. It is generally accepted that The formation ofNOx emission is mainly influenced by combustion physics andchemistry . In general NOX formation decreased when fusel oilwas used compared to pure gasoline. For instance Icingur and Calamtested exhaust emissions from an SI engine fueled with fusel oil. Theauthors indicated that NOX emissions decreased by increasing fusel oilconcentration compared with gasoline fuel. Similar trends wereobserved by Calam et al.  and Solmaz . Solmaz stated thatincomplete combustion ofthe fusel oilgasoline blend caused asignificant reduction in NOX formation by  . SimilarlyAwad et al.  observed a decrease in NOX formation when usingfusel oil. They explained the decreased NOX emission in the case of fuseloil by the higher water content of fusel oil. The same work by Simsekand Ozdalyan  also observed that NOX emission decreased withfusel oil usage whereas increasing the engine load increased in-cylindertemperatures which also results in higher NOx formation. The highestvalue of NOX reduction . was achieved with fusel oilconcentration of . Exhaust analysis also performed by Safieddinet al.  who used various blends of fusel oil with gasoline indicatedthat fusel oil produced fewer NOX emissions up to  than gasolinedue to lower combustion temperature as a result of water content in thefusel oil Fig. ..... UHC and CO emissions. The formation of CO emissions hasbeen reported to be linked to many factorsincluding fusel oilcharacteristics type of engine andor engine working conditions.Moreover the most critical parameter affecting the CO emissionsformation is in-complete combustion. In almost all the publishedliterature a remarkable increase in the amount of CO emissions wasreported when fusel oil was blended with gasoline fuel due to asignificant decrease in the temperature of the combustion products.In other words the energy generated from the combusted fusel oilTable Performance and exhaust emission characteristic of SI engines fueled by fusel oil blends in comparison with pure gasoline.Type of fuel blendEngine conditionsPerformance resultsEmission resultsF F FF F F FF FF FFBWE FAWEFBWE FAWEFAWE FAWEF F F FF F F Fdifferent speedsat full loaddifferent engine loaddifferent engine loadengine speed of  rpm  throttle open positiondifferent engine speed different engine loaddifferent engine speed  of WOTdifferent engine speed different engine loaddifferent engine loadDifferent loadBTEBSFCTorquePowerNOXCOUHCCORef.\\x0cS.M.

They also observed that as engine speedincreased the CO emission decreased.Similar results have been confirmed through the experimental studyby Solmaz et al.  who reported that compared to gasoline fuel thefusel oilgasoline mixture led to higher CO emissions  at a speedof  rpm and different engine loads. An increase in CO emissions. was also observed by Calam et al.  under variable ignitiontimings. The enhancement trend for the formation of CO emissions wassimilar to those established by Awad et al. . In a different studySafieddin Ardebili et al.  reported that CO emissions increased by as fusel oil concentration and engine load raised Fig. .However in contrast to the above-mentioned reports Simsek andOzdalyan  argued that the fusel oilgasoline blends produced sig-nificantly lower amounts of CO in comparison with neat gasoline fuel atall engine loads. The authors reported that CO emissions decreased by    and  for F F F and F re-spectively compared with gasoline fuel Fig. .Total UHC emissions were also impacted by fusel oil concentrationand engine working conditions. Based on the literature mentionedabove fusel oil usage led to a remarkable decrease in combustiontemperature. Consequently this reduction causes the formation of in-complete combustion products ICPs such as UHC and CO emissionsincreases. Actually higher CO and UHC emissions is one of the primarychallenges in using the blend of fusel oil and gasoline .Icingur and Calam  reported that UHC emissions showed a                      .  .  .  .  .  .

The indicated mean effective pressure IMEP model is one of thefactors to estimate the indicated torque in internal combustion enginesproviding valuable information about the amount of the fuel combus-tion energy converted into mechanical work. An increase in the fusel oilratio in the blend slightly decreases in-cylinder pressures when diffu-sion combustion commences and ultimately reducing the in-cylindertemperature as shown in Fig. . The observed reduction in in-cylinderpressure and the temperature is might be attributed to differences inthe fuels moistureoxygen contents . A similar result was alsoobtained in a different study conducted by Emiro and Mehmet who investigated the addition of fusel oil in diesel fuel .Later in a study on diesel-fusel oil fuel blends Yilmaz  con-firmed the previous findings but highlighted that at low engine loadsthe heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure reduction was intensifiedwith the addition of the fusel oil. This statement is supported by thechanging trends in COVimep  and in-cylinder pressure data depictedin Fig. . More recently Akcay and Ozer  also observed a similarreduction rate in the in-cylinder pressure with higher ratios of fusel oilin comparison with pure diesel fuel . They stated that the watercontent in the fuel blends and lower heating value of fusel oil ag-gravated the combustion process. They found that the remarkable re-duction in in-cylinder pressure . happened when  of fusel oilwas added in the diesel fuel .Abulut et al.  investigated the performance characteristics andemissions of a single-cylinder diesel engine fueled with   and of fusel oil blended in pure diesel and showed slight increases inthe maximum heat release rates and the maximum in-cylinder pressurein comparison with neat diesel. They attributed their achievement tothe better heat release rate of the blends caused by fusel oil. On thecontrary Ylmaz in their study did not observe any remarkable increasein heat release rate and In-cylinder pressure at all engine loads except atfull load as a result of fusel oil addition into diesel fuel. At full loadconditions the IMEP values increased with increasing fusel oil from to  .Injection delay is also an important parameter. It is worth quotingthat the longer ignition delay of fusel oil results in a comparativelyhigher heat release rate during combustion . Abulut et al. stated that the cetane number occasionally decreased when fusel oil-diesel fuel blends were used thereby increasing the duration of ignitiondelay at all engine speeds and loads.Similarly Yilmaz  also found that by increasing the fusel oilratio the ignition delay increased as shown in Fig.  .Similar findings were also observed by Awad et al.  and Akcayand Ozer   where both studies concluded that the lowcetane number and high latent heat of vaporization of fusel oil wereprimarily responsible for ignition delay.Fig. .

Similar results were observed by Solmaz .He found that fusel oilgasoline blends could increase the UHC emis-sions up to  when using the pure fusel oil fuel. He suggested thatthe reason to the enhancement of the emitted UHC would be the watercontent of the fusel oil and ignition timing. In a different study Awadet al.  strived to study the possibility of improving exhaust gasemission of a SI engine fueled with fusel oilgasoline by extraction ofwater. They highlighted the improved UHC emissions  ofFAWE and FAWE compared to FBWE and FBWE due to in-creased oxygen- and carbon-content of fusel oil after water extractionFig. Similar results were presented by Safieddin et al.  indicatingthe addition of fusel oil into pure gasoline could enhance UHC emissionup to . The rate of increase of UHC emission at higher level offusel oil was higher. They attributed their findings to the presence ofwater in fusel oil and engine working conditions.Contrary to the above-mentioned investigations in which blendingfusel oil with gasoline has been referred for its negative impacts on theUHC emissions in a study have reported otherwise i.e. reduced UHCemissions by using fusel oil. Simsek and Ozdalyan  reported thatthe addition of fusel oil to gasoline led to significantly decreased UHCproduction. The amount of UHC emissions was reduced by .. and . for F F and F respectively. They attrib-uted this reduction to the oxygen content of the fusel oil and increasedin-cylinder temperature... Using fusel oil in compression ignition engines... The effect on the engine performanceIn the literature there are research works in which fusel oil has beenconsidered as a green fuel-additive for CI engines although not as muchas SI engines. A number of experimental investigations have been re-ported on the use of fusel oil as a potential alternative blend componentfor CI engines. Very few data can be found on the combustion char-acteristics and performance of a CI engine fuel with fuel oil-dieselblends.

This improvement in BSFC could also be ex-plained by the low thermal energy of fusel oil . However at full-load conditions a slight decrease in engine torque was observed.Overall the impact of the addition of fusel oil into diesel fuel has beenreported to be negative and BSFC trends demonstrated a local max-imum  Table .Fig. .

Lowcetane number and moisture content of fusel oil lead to a slight de-crease in the engine power and torque in comparison with pure dieselfuel . Similar results i.e. slight brake power and engine torquereduction at higher blend levels were reported elsewhere when fusel oil was added into diesel  or  fusel oil was added intoB in comparison with neat diesel fuel . Hassan Pour et al. re-ported a slight increase . in engine brake power when fusel oilcontent increased from  to . This improvement could be at-tributed to the fact that oxygen molecules in the fusel oil could enhancethe thermal efficiency of the fuel mixture . Abulut et al.  re-ported that the addition of fusel oil to conventional diesel fuel caused agradual reduction in the brake thermal efficiency BTE in comparisonwith neat diesel fuel.However in almost all the published works the brake specific fuelconsumption BSFC showed opposite trends with respect to BTE. Forinstance Hassan Pour et al.  observed that as the fusel oil content inthe fuel mixture increased the BSFC also improved by  overbaseline diesel consumption due to a decrease in calorific value of thefuel mixture and an increase in the ignition delay . In addition tobiodiesel as an oxygenated additive of diesel fuel other fuel additivessuch as nano-biochar derived from sugarcane bagasse have also beenused to be a promising solution to improve the engine performance andreduce exhaust emissions. Very recently Safieddin Ardebili et al. also observed a similar increasing trend in BSFC as a result of the... Effect on engine emissions.... NOX emissions. Several studies have been performed in theliterature that were targeted at decreasing NOX emissions for dieselengines. A review of all of the reported literature up to  revealed aremarkable reduction of up to   in NOX emissions with the useof fusel oil as a fuel additive. For instance Awad et al. tested fusel oilblended into neat diesel fuel at different engine loadsspeeds andrecorded an average reduction of . in NOX emissionsincomparison with diesel fuel. Since the thermal energy of fusel oil islower than diesel fuel mixing of fusel oil with diesel fuel can decreasethereby reducing NOXthe gas temperature inside the cylinderis mainlyformation. Besidescorresponding to the reduction of NOX formation .the water contentin fusel oilNOX formation is highly dependent on the in-cylinder temperatureoxygen concentrations oxygen concentrations as well as ignitiontiming . Abulut et al.  studied the use of fusel oil blendsF F and F in direct diesel engine at full-load operating condi-tions. He concluded that the NOX emissions dropped sharply when thefusel oildiesel mixture changed from  to . Minimum NOxemissions were obtained at a fusel oil concentration of  and anengine speed of  rpm.A similar finding was also observed when referring to the reductionin NOX emissions when using the fusel oilbiodieseldiesel blends .Hassan Pour et al.  argued that the decrease in NOX emissions as aresult of fusel oil addition is attributed to engine working conditionsand the water content of fusel oil. Their findings revealed that NOxemissions decreased by up to . Furthermore at low engine loadsNOX emissions could be reduced .

Theyobserved a clear decrease in NOX emissions by . with increasingfusel oil percentage from  to ..... UHC and CO emissions. Although increasing fusel oilconcentration could lead to lower NOX formation rates this couldresult in higher UHC and CO formation rates due to locally lowertemperatures and worse combustion. For instance Awad et al. studied the addition of F into F. They reported that the engine loadof  followed by an engine load of  led to the highest COemissions in comparison with diesel fuel  and  respectively.Yilmaz  showed that the most important issue affecting theformation of CO emission derived from fusel oil combustion was thelower calorific value of fusel oil which in turn led to lower combus-tion chamber temperature. Hassan Pour et al.  also carried outexperiments using diesel fusel oilbiodiesel combination to achievethe best engine working condition and reported that CO emissions in-creased by more than . More specifically they stated that fusel oilis a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines due to itsorigin from a variety of alternative sources. Safieddin Ardebili et al. came to similar conclusions when studying the exhaust emissionsof various fusel oil mixtures and bio-based nano additives. They utilizednano-biochar as an additive to reduce the emissions of fuseldieselblends. However at higher levels of fusel oil the in-cylinder tempera-ture decreased sharply which resulted in higher CO emissions up to compared to neat diesel.In contrast to these reports Abulut et al.  reported that theaddition of fusel oil   and  into F decreased the producedCO emissions compared to neat diesel as shown in Fig. .Similar trends were also observed by Mehmet and Ozer  whostudied the exhaust emission of fusel oil fuel in which the engine speedfixed at a constant engine speed of  rpm. They indicated that COemissions reduced by up to . for all engine loads . Overall tominimize exhaust gas emissions from CO formation fuel blends with alow concentration of blended fusel oil and engine speed are preferred.Most of the efforts have focused on the negative impacts of fusel oiladdition on UHC emissions. For instance Abulu et al.  reported asignificant increase in UHC emissions of  with the usage of fusel oilwhen the engine operated at low loads conditions Fig. . Thy linkedthis improvement to the longer ignition delay duration and insufficientoxygen content.Similar results were reported when Fusel oilbiodiesel additive wasadded in diesel fuel.

Fusel oil usage on homogeneous charge compression ignition modeHomogeneous charge compression ignition HCCI combustionwhich is presented firstly by Noguchi and Onishi in   is apromising technology providing low NOx and soot emissions level si-multaneously. The airfuel mixture is prepared entirely homogeneousas similar as SI engines and the start of the combustion is obtained byself auto-ignition during compression stroke like CI engines .Entirely homogeneous mixture prevents soot formation during com-bustion. Due to the nature of the HCCI combustion mode the opera-tional airfuel ratio is considerably higher than the stoichiometric airfuel ratio which means the engine is operated with very lean mixtures.Thanks to the lean mixture combustion end temperatures are quite lowcompared to SI and CI combustion modes. As a result of the lowercombustion temperatures NOx emissions are reduced by almost zero.The heat loss from the cylinder walls to the engine coolant also reducesbecause of the low in-cylinder temperatures. This phenomenon alsocontributes HCCI engine to provide high thermal efficiency which isanother attractive side of HCCI combustion even at low compressionratios . HCCI studies were commonly carried out by utilizingreference fuels of isooctane and n-heptan. However the idea to com-bine the advantages of biofuels and HCCI combustion mode forced re-searchers to perform HCCI experiments by using renewable fuels as well. Currently there are three studies available related HCCIcombustion utilizing the fusel oil as an energy source .... Effect of the fusel oil percentage on HCCI combustionThe chemical structure of the fuel is one of the most importantparameters affecting the HCCI combustion. HCCI combustion is com-pletely controlled by chemical kinetics. The auto-ignition temperatureof the fuel is the main responsible for the start of combustion in HCCImode. Required heat to increase the fuel temperature is provided bycompression during the compression stroke heat flux from residualgases and cylinder walls. The research octane number RON directlyaffects the auto-ignition of the airfuel mixture. The high octane ratingof the fuel causes a delay in the start of the combustion and combustionphase . The research octane number of fusel oil is about similar to ethanol. It has a considerably high auto-ignition resistancewhich is a handicap for HCCI combustion. Therefore it is very difficultto obtain HCCI combustion by using pure fusel oil especially at lowcompression ratios and intake air temperatures. HCCI combustion stu-dies using fuels with high octane number such as ethanol methanol etc.were conducted by blending these fuels with highly reactive fuels suchas n-heptane diesel etc. . A similar approach was used in thefusel oil HCCI studies .Calam  investigated the effects of the fusel oil percentage infusel oiln-heptane fuel blends on HCCI combustion. Three differentFig. . Effects of the fusel oil percentage on cylinder pressure and heat releaserate of HCCI engine .fusel oiln-heptane fuel blend of F  fusel oil   n-heptaneF  fusel oil   n-heptane and F  fusel oil   n-heptane were tested and compared with pure n-heptan operation inthis study. In-cylinder pressure traces and heat release rate variationsare seen in Fig. . Calam reported that the start of the combustionadvanced and closed to the n-heptane as the fusel oil percentage de-crease in the fuel blend. This case is related to the octane ratings of theblended fuels. The research octane numbers of the F F and Fare about   and  respectively. As is seen on the graph thecombustion started too late with F fuel blend. This is an indicatorthat the engine may not run properly for a wide range. This will also becaused to the engine to be run just in a narrow operation range bymeans of engine speed and load.However the narrowing in operation range is not directly related tothe fusel oil or the type of fuel. Fig.  will be convenient to explain thatin detail. Solmaz  conducted a study to compare the performanceof the fusel oil in an HCCI engine. In order to perform a suitable eva-luation the results were compared with the experimental test resultsobtained with reference fuels of isooctane and n-heptane. Comparisonof fusel oil and reference fuels was performed under the same RON of. RON  isooctane and  n-heptane and Fusel .fusel oil and . n-heptane were tested at the same intake airtemperature of  K. As seen in Fig.  the operation range of theengine almost the same in terms of IMEP engine speed and load forboth types of fuel. Additionally it was reported that the Fusel pro-vided slightly leaner combustion at the misfire region and slightly ri-cher combustion around the knocking region. This means the engineoperation range was slightly increased to both high load and low load.Another comparison study for fusel oil was performed by Calamet al. . In this study six different fuels ethanol fusel oil methanolbutanol isopropanol and naptha were compared by blending themwith  n-heptane. Fig.  illustrates a sample of the comparisonperformed in this study. Sampling fuels from this study were selected asF  fusel oil and  n-heptane and E  ethanol and n-heptane to reveal the performance of fusel oil versus to ethanol. It isclearly seen in Fig.  that the operation maps are almost similar toeach other. Compared to fusel oil ethanol just has an advantage interms of obtained slightly higher IMEP at low engine speeds. Exceptthis it can be said that both of the fuels performed a similar perfor-mance. It is also clear that the heat release and in-cylinder pressuretraces are also very similar for F and E as seen in Fig. . The peakpressures and the peak heat release rate values are almost the same justwith an offset in the crank angle. Its seen that the combustion start acouple of crank angle degrees before with F fuel compared to E. Itmight be caused because of the products in the fusel oil having a lowerboiling temperature range. This is another evidence that fusel oil and\\x0cS.M. Safieddin Ardebili et al.Fuel   Fig. . Comparison of the HCCI engine operation maps for fusel oil-heptane and isooctanen-heptane blends at the same RON of  .ethanol has very close engine performance and fusel oil can find moreapplication field.... Effect of the intake temperature and compression ratioIntake air temperature and compression ratio are critical parametersaffecting HCCI combustion and engine performance. Despite there is nodirect control mechanism on the start of combustion such as spark ig-nition HCCI combustion is directly affected by the intake air tem-perature and the compression ratio of the engine. An increase in intakeair temperature or compression ratio allows the airfuel mixture to beignited easier. On the other hand increasing these parameters too muchmay cause an increase in the maximum pressure rise rate by advancingthe combustion phase before the top dead center. In addition volu-metric efficiency drops with the increase of intake air temperature andas a result of this performance loss might have decreased . Calam compared the operation maps for F  fusel oil and  n-heptane at two different intake air temperatures of  K and  K. Itwas reported that increased intake air temperature provided a wideroperation range for HCCI engine. As seen in Fig.  the operation rangeof the HCCI engine enlarged for both speed range and load range.Another issue about increasing intake air temperature is to providingFig. .

Variation of HC emissions with respect to air excess ratio for different fuel blends  and HC emission map for Fusel .energy is required to heat the air especially for high temperatures.Exhaust waste heat might be a reliable solution to heat the intakeair. K is a suitable temperature to obtain with the heat of exhaustgases for HCCI engines. However  K intake air temperature may notbe obtained for the whole operation range with the waste heat of ex-haust gases because HCCI combustion is low-temperature combustionand exhaust gas temperature dramatically drops especially at lowloads. Therefore without energy exergy based analysis its so difficultto compare these maps for real-life applications.Solmaz  examined the effects of the compression ratio onHCCI combustion in the use of Fusel fuel and compared the resultswith the RON. Experiments were conducted on three different com-pression ratios of   and . It was reported that the increase in thecompression ratio provided both enlarging in the operation range of theengine and a slight decrease in BSFC. Fusel and RON which RONnumber of same as  were provided nearly the same operation ranges.However maximum engine torque was slightly higher for Fuselthanks to the high latent heat of evaporation that caused a delay on thestart of combustion especially at high compression ratios. Fig.  il-lustrates the comparison of indicated thermal efficiency values forFusel and RON at three different compression ratios. At firstglance the red region on the RON map seems to be larger forRON.However it can be said that Fusel provided higher ITE for a widerrange compared to RON. The ITE values for RON are lower thanFusel especially at high engine loads. The start of the combustion isadvanced at high engine loads because the wall temperatures andresidual gas temperatures increase at high loads. In this case the ad-vanced start of combustion caused a decrease in IMEP. As a result ofthis ITE values may decrease. However the high latent heat of va-porization of fusel oil prevents the advancing start of combustion tosome extent. This result indicates that fusel oil can be used as an al-ternative to reference fuels. It also may provide higher performance if avariable compression ratio strategy is applied.... Emission characteristics of fusel oil in HCCI modeConventional compression ignition engines are preferred for roadtransportation due to their high energy conversion efficiency comparedto spark ignition engines . However compression ignition enginessuffer from NOx and soot emissions . Conventional com-bustion and injection strategies are not sufficient to eliminate NOx andsoot emissions simultaneously in compression ignition engines twomain stages of combustion . In the pre-mixed combustionphase all of the fuel accumulated in the cylinder during the ignitiondelay period starts to burn rapidly. Thus uncontrolled heat releaseoccurs in the cylinder which increases temperature and pressure re-markably. Excessive in-cylinder temperature triggers NOx formation ofthe engine working with low equivalence ratios as seen in Fig. . It ispossible to reduce the NOx emission by increasing the equivalence ratiothat will also resulted an increase in the duration of the diffusioncombustion phase. In the diffusion phase combustion is controlled bythe diffusion rate of the fuel injected into the cylinder. Combustionspeed depends on the evaporation of the fuel droplets in the spray. In\\x0cS.M. Safieddin Ardebili et al.Fuel   case of insufficient time to evaporation and mixing with air liquid fueldroplets in the spray are exposed to thermal cracking because of thehigh temperature surrounding the spray and soot formation starts. Be-cause of this nature of the conventional diesel combustion it is notpossible to reduce both NOx and soot emissions together. HCCI mode isa combustion mode providing nearly zero soot and NOx emissions likeother low temperature combustion modes. The airfuel mixture isprepared entirely homogeneous in HCCI mode . Besidesa lean mixture provides high oxygen concentration. Thus the thermalcracking possibility of the fuel is prevented and soot emissions arecompletely eliminated in HCCI and other LTC modes. As a result of leancombustion the in-cylinder temperature does not increase up to NOxformation temperature so NOx emissions can also be reduced. How-ever extremely lean combustion and low combustion temperaturescause an increase in CO and HC emissions. CO results from a lack ofoxygen in conventional compression ignition and spark ignition engines. Although the oxygen concentration is higher in HCCIcombustion due to the lean combustion high CO emissions are ob-served due to the incomplete combustion. The combustion process isinterrupted because of the low in-cylinder gas temperature whichprevents the chemical reactions. Low combustion temperature alsocauses an increase in HC emissions especially regions close to the cy-linder walls and crevice. However HC and CO emissions can be re-duced by catalytic converter easily if the exhaust gas temperaturereaches  C.Oxygenated fuels such as alcohols also promote the reduction of theNOx and soot emissions of HCCI engines. The high latent evaporationheat of alcohols reduce the compression end temperatures in the cy-linder thus peak in-cylinder gas temperatures during combustion de-crease. Fig.  illustrates the NOx emissions in an HCCI engine operatedwith fusel oil-n-heptane fuel blends. It is seen that the NOx emissionlevel is quite low compared to compression ignition and spark ignitionengines. Calam  specified that almost  times lower NOx emis-sions were obtained in HCCI combustion compared to spark ignitionmode at an air excess ratio of .. Besides as the air excess ratio in-creased NOx emissions decreased significantly and almost zero NOxwere recorded after air excess ratio of . This trend of NOx emissions isrelated to the decreasing in-cylinder gas temperatures with the increaseof air excess ratio. It is also seen that the same air excess coefficientsfusel oil blends provided lower NOx emissions compared to referencefuel of n-heptane. The high latent heat of evaporation of fusel oil causesgas temperatures to decrease. Therefore fusel oil usage promotes thereduction of NOx like other alcohol-based fuels. There are two otherstudies about HCCI combustion utilizing fusel oil. Solmaz  re-ported that the NOx emissions were lower than  ppm in the use ofFusel for all operation range of the HCCI engine. Calam et al. compared fusel oil combustion in an HCCI engine with five differentfuels and in this study NOx emissions were not reported.Calam et al. compared fusel oil combustion in an HCCI engine withfive different fuel blends. Fig.  left graph illustrates the comparison ofCO emissions in HCCI engine for the alcohol-based fuels blended withnheptane by volume of . CO emission increases with the air excessratio due to the decreasing in-cylinder gas temperature. It can also beseen that the CO emissions of F fuel are higher than other fuel blends.As it was mentioned before fusel oil is higher alcohol and its closedchemical formula is defined as CHO. Its higher carbon numbercompared to alcohols such as ethanol methanol and butanol causeshigh CO emissions. The increase in CO emissions occurs not only forHCCI combustion but also spark ignition combustion. Previous studiesabout fusel oil usage on spark ignition combustion mode demonstratethat fusel oil causes an increase in CO emissions due to its higher carbonconcentration . Due to the same reason fusel oil alsocauses high HC emissions in both HCCI combustion and spark ignitioncombustion. As can be seen in Fig.  left higher HC emissions wererecorded with F fuel blend at all air excess ratios in HCCI combus-tion. The right side graphs in Fig.  and Fig.  demonstrate CO andHC emission maps depending on the lambda and compression ratio forHCCI combustion. It can be said that CO emissions decrease at a highcompression ratio thanks to the increased gas temperatures in the cy-linder. A decrease in HC emissions is also expected with increasingcompression ratio. Crevice regions and wall temperatures are also has agreat effect on HC formation. However lambda is the main parameterdetermining CO and HC formation in the cylinder as it is understoodfrom Fig.  right and Fig.  right.. Conclusions outlook and recommendationsAlcohols are promising alternative fuels for internal combustionengines. Higher alcohols having a carbon number of  and more arecalled next-generation alcohols and their usage in internal combustionengines is investigated by many researchers. Fusel oil which is a by-product of the fermentation process and abundantly produces over theworld during ethanol production especially consists of mostly higheralcohols. Despite its abundant production rate fusel oil couldnt find awide application area to be utilized except for some research studiesabout the production of biodiesel and bio-lubricant. The idea of fusel oilas a renewable energy source for internal combustion engines wasgenerated in the past decade and its usability studies in both com-pression ignition and spark ignition engines was started. In this study acomprehensive review was conducted to combine the effects of the fuseloil usage in internal combustion engines and present the advantagesand limitations of it as an alternative fuel. According to the literaturesurvey the crucial findings can be listed as below. The high octane number of the fusel oil is a promising feature forspark-ignition engines in particular. Fusel oil-gasoline blends allowthe engine to be operated at higher compression ratios. As a result ofthis energy the conversion ratio can be increased in real-life ap-plications and total CO release can be reduced.. It was reported that fusel oil has a positive effect on engine torqueexcept two studies. Despite its low lower heating value the calorificvalue of the mixture is almost the same compared to gasoline. Theoxygenated structure of the fusel oil also heals the combustion. Dueto these reasons the engine torque increased in most of the studies.. The raw fusel oil includes water about  by volume dependingon the distillation process and the after storage conditions. The re-duction in engine torque can be explained by the water content ofthe fusel oil.. Because of its lower calorific value fusel oil led to an increase inbrake specific fuel consumption for both spark ignition and com-pression ignition engines. This will cause a reduction in the totaldrive range for the vehicle with the same storage capacity.. Fusel oil seems to be suitable for spark ignition engines due to itsalcohol-based properties. Fusel oil provides a proper blend withgasoline without phase separation. However phase separation oc-curs in diesel-fusel oil blends especially higher fusel oil rates after. This might be caused because of several types of alcohols andwater in the fusel oil.. NOx emissions reduced for both SI and CI engines in case of usingfusel oil. The water content of it has a great impact on the reductionin NOx emissions. On the other hand water cause an increase inincomplete combustion product of CO. For CI engines fusel providesa simultaneous reduction in NOx and soot emissions thanks to thewater content and oxygenated structure. The simultaneous reduc-tion in NOx and soot is a great achievement because CI enginessuffer from these emissions which are not possible to reduce to-gether.. Fusel oil causes higher CO and HC emissions in HCCI mode due to itshigher carbon content compared to other alcohol such as ethanolmethanol and buthanol.. In HCCI mode fusel oil has a similar performance with ethanol andreference fuels. Ethanol like features makes fusel oil more attractive.\\x0cS.M. Safieddin Ardebili et al.Fuel   The results indicated that fusel oil could be used as an alternativefuel in internal combustion engines like ethanol.The performance loss reported in some of the studies can beeliminated by removing the water from the fusel oil. This will also behelpful to the extent drive range of the vehicles. As it was mentionedbefore fusel oil includes several types of alcohols. This structure makesit unstable for different operation conditions. The chemical propertiesof the fusel oil can be improved by removing some of the worthlesstypes of products. This may allow to increase octane rating and lowerheating value of fusel oil together. Fusel oil may also be a proper al-ternative fuel for homogeneous charged combustion engines. Its lessreactive feature may help the control of the start of the combustion andcombustion phase especially for HCCI combustion. The performance ofthe fusel oil on HCCI mode can be improved further if a variablecompression ratio strategy is applied.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing financialinterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influ-ence the work reported in this paper.References Uyumaz A Aksoy F Boz F Ylmaz E.

IntroductionNanotechnologies are one of the main and novel topics in internalcombustion engines ICEs. Nanotechnologies in ICEs have a widerange of applications such as nano-uids nano-composites nano-rubbers nano-materials etc. Based on our experience in nanouids ap-plication in heat transfer  they have excellent efciency in the heattransfer and lubrication process which motivated the researchers to ex-amine those applications in ICEs as nano-coolant and nano-lubricantswhich are reviewed at two other parts of this review study. Further-more combustion characteristics of some nanoparticles make themsuitable for using as nano-fuel additives which is presented here inICEs applications. ICEs can use different base fuels due to their advan-tages. For instance Ghazikhani et al.  used ethanol additives togasoline engines for reducing the exhaust emissions and exergy recov-ery improvements. Hatami et al.  used the diesel engines forthe heat recovery applications  such as Combined Heating andPower CHP cycles by using different heat exchanger designs.The most important usage of nanouids is additives to fuels which iswidely introduced by researchers. Gad and Jayaraj  blended Nanoadditives such as Carbon Nano Tubes CNTs TiO and AlO to the bio-diesel fuel and found that biodiesel blend with nano AlO as JAli.e.  Jatropha biodiesel ppm AlO led to a maximum im-provement of . in thermal efciency compared with all otherexperimented fuels. Jatropha biodiesel blend with CNTs as JC Jatropha biodiesel ppm CNT produced higher decreases inCO and NOx emissions about  and  respectively compared withall tested fuels. Also Jatropha biodiesel blend with TiO as JT pro-duced higher reductions in HC and smoke emissions about  and respectively compared to all other fuels. Fig.  shows the SEM im-ages of CNTs TiO and AlO used in their study which conrms thenano-scales of added nanoparticles.Gharehghani and Pourrahmani  used CeO for the diesel engineshown in Fig.  and investigated the engine performance such as BrakeSpecic Fuel Consumption BSFC and emissions in different part permillions ppms. They reported that if the focus of analysis changes tohigher Brake Thermal Efciency BTE like previous investigationsthe values of biodiesel and nano-particles should be approximatelyabout  and  ppm respectively.Hoseini et al.  used the graphene oxide GO nano-particles ad-ditives in biodiesel-diesel blends. Their results showed that by usingGO power and Exhaust Gas Temperature EGT signicantly increase.Furthermore by using GO nano-particles signicant reductions in CO and Unburned Hydro-Carbons UHCs  were ob-served. Other nanoparticle additives such as AlO and FeO were usedin diesel engines by Aalam . In this complete review study in threedifferent parts all three nano-liquid applications are gathered anddiscussed on the effects on the engines performance especially forthe nano-fuel additives. So the main achievement of this project is us-able for the car industries to nd how they can improve the engines ef-ciency using nanotechnology such as nanouids application in fuelsadditives cooling and lubrication processes. They can nd best nano-material for the fuel coolant and lubricant to have the greatest perfor-mance and minimum losses on the engine performance and emissions.Furthermore this project considered both the experimental and numer-ical studies to report the industrial and educational achievements.. NanofuelsNano-fuels are dened as the common fuels which nanoparticles asadditives were added to it to improve its combustion characteristics. Inthis study common fuels which are considered as the base fuel are die-sel gasoline bio-diesel alcoholic and blended fuels. Elahi et al. reviewed the studies related to nano-additives to the diesel-biodieselfuels. Their review results generally conrmed an enhancement in thethermophysical properties improvement in the heat transfer rate andstabilization of the fuel mixtures as well as an increase in the engine per-formance parameters and reduction in the harmful exhaust emissionsdepending on the nanouid additives dosage . As a main resultthey concluded that alumina FeCl CeO MnO CuO metallic nano ad-ditives nanoparticles reduced the ignition delay signicantly in dieselengines. They also introduced the secondary atomization splittinglarger fuel droplets into smaller and ner droplets as shown in Fig. as one of the main mechanisms for nanoparticles combustion improve-ments. Also they pointed out that oxygen in nanoparticles structure andwater as emulsion produces micro-explosion due to rapid evapora-tion and very ne size fuel droplets which is formed and enhanced thecombustion properties. Among their reviewed studies GrapheneNano-Platelets GNPs had better micro-explosion process than AlOand CeO due to weaker van der Waals forces. Also they reported thatTiO additive was more efcient than other applied nanoparticles forenhancing the engines power . Furthermore they mentioned thatFig. . SEM images of CNTs TiO and AlO used for diesel engine .\\x0cM. Hatami M. Hasanpour and D. JingJournal of Molecular Liquids   Fig. . Experimental setup for nano-additives in diesel engine .higher oxygen content and presence of lower aromatic compounds re-duced the exhaust emissions such as unburned hydrocarbons UBHCcarbon monoxide CO and particulate matters PM signicantly dueto enhanced ignition characteristics by adding the metallic and oxygen-ated additives. The effect of oxygenated additives on the reaction withfuel will be discussed in Section . But these additives lead to the forma-tion of NOx due to the excess amount of oxygen supplied to the fuel. An-other main advantage of nano-fuel is BSFC reduction due to highercaloric value of nanofuel catalytic oxidation improvement and com-plete combustion for these types of blended fuel . These effects de-pends on nanoparticles type which are discussed in next sections indetails.CeO copper and AlO were introduced as the more reasonablenanoparticles due to viscosity index increment and ash point and igni-tion delay reduction as well as the emissions reduction and combustionimprovements .Dewangan et al.  reviewed the effect of metal oxide nanoparticlesadditives such as SeO to diesel engines and reported that metal oxidenanoparticles and oxygenated additives such as Diethyl Ether DEE de-rived from ethanol had low auto-ignition temperature high oxygen con-tent and outstanding cetane number so improve the combustion andemissions signicantly. Also Nanthagopal et al.  reviewed the studiesabout nanoparticles and alcohol additives to diesel engines and reportedthat zinc oxide and carbon nanotubes are the most preferable nanoparti-cles compared to others due to their better anticorrosion effect and ther-mal conducting behaviors. Another study on the engine performanceenhancement fuel properties improvements and exhaust emissionsreductions by nano-additives and alcoholic additives is performed byFayyazbakhsh and Pirouzfar . Khond and Kriplani  reviewed thestudies which are approved until  about the nanoparticle additivesto diesel stationary engines to reduce the exhaust emissions. Based ontheir review most of researchers stated that addition of nanoparticles infuels improve cetane number and caloric value of fuel. Some of re-searchers such as BankoviIli et al.  focused on the bio-diesel syn-thesis by the nano-catalysts such as calcium oxide CaO as a cheaphighly active and easily available in different forms of nano CaO catalystsneat doped loaded which are not considered in this review study... Additives to diesel fuelsIn this section as summarized in Table  the nanoparticles added todiesel fuel is reviewed and the main effect reported is mentioned to becompared. Based on this table AlO CuO CNT and CeO are the mostused nanoparticles as diesel additives. In most cases density viscositycetane number and heating value of nanofuel were increased and con-sequently BTE is improved while the BSFC and harmful emissionswere reduced.Based on Dhahad et al.  short review graphene oxide in Jatrophafuel had the maximum thermal efciency  maximum fuel con-sumption reduction  HC  CO  and NOx  reduced.After GO cerium oxide CeO had more suitable results for diesel en-gine applications. The JIS diesel fuel and waste cooking oil based bio-diesel fuels were used by Caliskan and Mori . They studied the nano-particles emissions and reported that diesel fuel had more carbon andFig. .

So diesel fuel had greater COand HC emissions and lesser CO and NOx emissions than biodieselfuels . Approximately in all studies in nanoparticles additive todiesel fuels micro-explosion phenomenon is introduced as the mainreason of combustion improvements this phenomena makes instanta-neous and intense vaporization of the water droplets within the fuelwhen the fuel is exposed to high temperature gas so large fuel dropletsare broken into many smaller droplets and signicantly improve thefuel vaporization and combustion process .

Additives to bio-diesel fuelsCeO TiO CNT and AlO are the most used nanoparticles as addi-tives to bio-diesel fuels as presented in Table . Among these nanopar-ticles AlO had better results in BTE improvements CNT for CO andNOx reduction TiO for HC and soot reduction and CeO for BSFCreductions.As an example of nano-additives to bio diesel Kumar et al. added the TiO to waste orange peel oil biodiesel and found that BTE in-creased up to . and . with OOME OOME-T and OOME-Tfuels.

Patel et al.  also performed the samestudy for producing the bio-diesel from waste engine oil WEOthrough the blending of pyrolytic oil in diesel fuel and showed thatthe highest caloric value of the blended oil was obtained at  blend-ing . Some other studies produced biodiesel from waste oils can befound in  for instance reusable nano-catalyst FeOCsO  is applied to produce bio-diesel from fat extracted from tan-nery waste.Gad and Jayaraj  added the CNTs TiO and AlO to Jatropha bio-diesel and found a power increase in all nanoparticles due to the surfaceto the volume ratio of nanoparticles. Furthermore they reported a re-duction in the ignition delay and combustion duration of the fuel dueto higher peak cylinder pressure and faster heat release rate. Alsothey mentioned some other benets of nanoparticle addition to thefuel such as better fuel droplet propagation and injected fuel disper-sion better reaction surfaces as a potential catalyst fuel-air mixing im-provements improvements of fuel droplet propagation and injectedfuel dispersion smaller droplets lower fuel viscosity and expose tohigher effective fuel surface . In another study which investigatedthe effect of base biodiesel graphene oxide GO nanoparticles wereadded to three types of oilseeds namely evening primrose Oenotheralamarckiana the fruit of tree of heaven Ailanthus altissima andCamelina Camelina sativa by Hoseini et al.  and found that thetree of heaven contains  oil which was higher than the eveningprimrose  and Camelina . Sadhik Basha  reported thatCNT and DEE with the biodiesel emulsion fuels can shortened the igni-tion delay and exhibited higher brake thermal efciency and reducedemissions NO smoke than that of pure diesel and biodiesel... Additive to dieselbiodiesel blended fuelsBased on Table  analysis CeO GO AlO CNT and TiO are themost used nanoparticles additives to dieselbiodiesel blended fuels.These nanoparticles had benets such as higher premixed combustionheat release rate higher thermal conductivity catalyst function oxygencontents and more free radicals faster burning and etc. which makesthem more favorable for BSFC reduction emissions reduction and ef-ciency improvements for ICEs. In Section  the most characteristics ofthese nanoparticles are presented for more information.As an example of dieselbiodiesel blended fuel Hoseini et al. mixed the biodiesel obtained from Oenothera lamarckiana with dieselfuel in the ratio of  B and nano-graphene oxide powder withdosage of   and  ppm were added to blended fuel using the ul-trasonic approach. They concluded that engine power increased due toprevent of deposition by nanoparticles and reduction in friction losses.Also they showed that nano-particles increased the heat of evaporationand decreased the ignition delay and the combustion duration somakes higher peak cylinder pressure and faster heat release rate .Another study on the blended fuels is performed by addition of ceriumoxide by following structures tyre pyrolysis oil of  diesel of  withcerium oxide nano additives  ppm BD CeO  ppm tyre py-rolysis oil of  diesel of  with cerium oxide nano additives  ppmBD CeO  ppm tyre pyrolysis oil of  diesel of  withcerium oxide nano additives  ppm BD  CeO  ppm andtyre pyrolysis oil of  diesel of  with cerium oxide nano additives ppm BD  CeO  ppm.

Venu et al.  improved the combustion characteris-tics by ternary diesel-biodiesel-ethanol blends and nano additives.They used  ethanol but proposed that additional studies can be ex-tended with higher ethanol content with the nal optimized enginecondition. Also Kumar Sonia et al.  revealed that  MethanolD  M with nanoparticles blend produced lower emissions exceptNOx emission. So it was selected as an optimum blend in their applica-tion. They mentioned the reason of this behavior for oxygen content inmethanol lower cetane number and consequently higher in-cylindertemperature makes reduction in HC and smoke. Addition of waternano-droplets reduces the combustion temperature and consequentlyreduces NOx due to its heat sinking effect which takes the heat of com-bustion chamber to evaporate. Also increasing the methanol ratio in thefuel blend makes an increase in the BSFC due to lower heating value ofthe blend fuel .Mardi et al.  used blended Ethanol-Methanol-Butanol fuelswith CNT AlO and TiO nano additives and found signicant improve-ment in every aspect of performance such as enhanced brake powerBP and brake thermal efciency BTE by . and . respectivelyalong with the BSFC reduction by .

NPs can de-crease the oxidation temperature and improve the cetane number ofthe fuel. By improving the cetane number the ignition features were en-hanced and the evaporation of fuel droplets increased signicantly. Sothe evaporation process makes enhancement of combustion processand consequently makes signicant reduction of engine emissions andheat release rates . Based on their review carbon nanotubes andnanoaluminum particles reduced the emissions of these three kindsof exhaust gases importantly . A complete review on the nanopar-ticles effect on engine performance is presented in Table . For instanceSiO with the lowest thermal conductivity recorded highest cylinderpressure and shortest ignition delay especially at DS . AbdulSheriff et al.  revealed that  ppm CNT added to dieselbiodieselblend increased the brake thermal efciency up to .. This factwas observed because of its lower viscosity causing in improved atom-ization and evaporation and consequently improving combustion ef-ciency . In next sub-sections the effect of nanoparticles to enginesperformances will be discussed in more details statistically... BSFC and fuel consumptionsBSFC is dened as the fuel mass ow rate per unit brake power ob-tained. Table  compare the BSFC EGT BTE and power changes usingdifferent nanoparticles and base fuels. Based on this table in all nano-particle additives BSFC is reduced and BTE is increased which are themost reasonable issues for using nanoparticles. But percentages ofthese effects depend on nanoparticle type and concentration. So it canbe found that for the BSFC reduction purposes the best nanoparticlesare CeO  TiO . GO  CNT .AlO . for diesel engines and MnO . for SI en-gines. Maximum exhaust temperature decrease reported for AlO while maximum BTE improvements occurred for MWCNT. AlO . CeO  CNT . GO .As an example of Table s data Fig.  is obtained from the literaturewhich shows the BSFC and BTE improvements using ZNO and ALOadditives to diesel fuels in  and  ppm dosages. Chen et al.  re-ported high EGT for CNT blends due to the highest caloric value andproduce more heat per unit mass compared to AlO and SiO blends.Also long ignition delay of CNT blends caused slower fuel burning pro-cess and the combustion gases had higher temperature.Although most researchers revealed that nanoparticles decreasedthe BSFC due to increase in the caloric value and higher surface areaof metallic additives  but some researchers such as Zhang et al. believed that lower heating value LHV of nanofuel which denespower output cannot be improved by such small amount of additivesso brings negligible difference to fuel consumption.As seen in Fig.  Chacko et al.  showed that higher BSFC occurredfor GO and GNP due to the limited caloric value of biodiesel. These ad-ditives improved the oxidation of carbon and thus ensured efcientcombustion. To have minimum BSFC GO nanoparticles were appliedwith a concentration of  ppm and GNPs with  ppm. For instancethe optimum concentrations of GO and GNP reduced the BSFC by .and  for D respectively . Another advantages of nanoparticleadditives is presented by Mei et al.  which used CNT and nano-MoO in fuel blends and conrmed that they can act as enhancers ofthe cetane number and consequently increase the heat and mass trans-fer during the low-temperature chemical reaction. The similar reason ofhigher cetane index is mentioned by Ahmed et al.  to conrm thehigher fuel conversion efciency for graphite blends as compared toFO-blends as shown in Fig. . Also ability of nanoparticles to acceleratethe combustion is another reason of BSFC reduction for CNT blendsmentioned by researchers .Based on Table  maximum BSFC reduction occurred for MNO ad-ditives to gasoline fuel as depicted in Fig. . Amirabedi et al.  re-ported that BSFC of engine can be reduced by . with ethanoladdition while it can be further decreased to . and . byadding  ppm and  ppm nano-oxides to blend of gasoline-ethanolrespectively. Kumar et al.  also showed that diesel BSFC value islower than biodiesel while OOME-T and OOME-T by TiO addi-tives produced lower BSFC compared with pure OOME and caused adecrease in smoke emission due to the rapid evaporation and the inci-dence of the enhanced air-fuel mixture. Furthermore NOx reductionwas due to the higher cetane number and decreasing the combustiontemperature. In a comparison study performed by Sheriff et al. CNT showed higher fuel consumption for orange oil compared to CeOdue to rapid oxidation which was the result of higher carbon and\\x0cM. Hatami M. Hasanpour and D.

BTE and combustion characteristicsIn this section BTE and other combustion characteristics are pre-sented which have signicant effects on engines performance. Basedon Table  and as mentioned maximum BTE improvements occurredfor MWCNT . AlO . CeO  CNT .GO . Ignition delay ID is one of the most important parameterwhich affects the combustion quality. Chacko et al.  investigated theeffect of Graphene oxide GO and Graphene nano platelet GNP on theID and presented that GNP addition reduced the ID up to . CAD asdepicted in Fig.  and the maximum change of ID reduction wasnoted for WBD with  ppm of GNP. They considered that GO hadlimited thermal conductivity when compared to GNP and it hadoxygen-carrying functional groups to promote the early combustion offuel. On the other hand higher thermal conductivity of the GNP im-proved the evaporation rate of fuel droplets and improved the BTE .Mei et al.  used CNT and found that it prompts the fuel and air tomix more rapidly and sufciently for later complete combustion. In ad-dition since the ame is disposed to circulate in small gaps such asholes layers and tubes the specic tubular structure of CNT plays apractical role in accelerating the fuel burning rate and minimizing theID which has signicance results in the benecial increase in BTEs .Furthermore increase in carbon content of CNT blends makes inhigher caloric value affecting condently on the BTE improvements. Also when CNT and surfactant is mixed with fuel a quick evapora-tion will occur and results improved combustion and less ignition delayperiod compared to CeO . Micro-explosion events because of largesurface-volume ratio and intensied thermal transmissibility of nano-particles is another reason of combustion improvements presented bySahoo and Jain  for CuO nanoparticles. Karthikeyan and Prathima Kumaravel et al.  and Gowtham et al.  also mentioned thesurface to volume ratio of fuel droplets and nano-additives improvesthe evaporation rate and leads to shorter ignition delay and combustionimprovements for TiOSiO CeO and GO nanoparticles respectively.In-cylinder pressure is another main parameter which affects thecombustion process and widely is investigated by researchers sepa-rately. Liu et al.  as seen in Fig.  found that maximum in-cylinder pressures of CeO and CeO increased by . and. due to higher catalytic activity at high temperature and reducedthe activation energy of diesel fuel also they indicated that the ignitiondelay period shortens while the peak heat release rate increases .Kumaran et al.  also conrmed that the fuel with higher caloricvalue and smaller viscosity leads to higher BTE for entire load range dur-ing complete combustion due to the improved combustion atomizationand rapid evaporation of the nanoparticles. Dhinesh et al.  also im-proved the BTE and reduced BSEC by nanoadditive-based blends dueFig. . In-cylinder pressure and heat release for CeO nanoparticle additives .to the oxygen vacancy capability of the additive which enhanced thecombustion efciency Fig. .Hoseini et al.  increased the engine power by GO nanoparticlesadditives which increased the heat of fuel evaporation so the densityof the fuel-air mixture increased and consequently power improved.Devarajan et al.  revealed that catalytic activity of AgO nano-additives enhanced the heat transfer which outcomes was improvedcombustion and great BTE  Mehregan and Moghiman  proposedCoO nanoparticles had better enhancement in BTE than MnO nano-additives because of higher caloric value of the blended fuel withCoO compared to MnO  Fig. ... Exhaust emissionsIn this section all the studies are compared based on the pollutantemissions which are harmful for the human. Among the existenceemissions NOx CO UHC and soot smoke PM are considered andanalyzed by all researchers to can minimize them by nano-additiveswhile unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde acetaldehydeFig. . ID and BTE for GO and GNP additives .\\x0cM. Hatami M. Hasanpour and D. JingJournal of Molecular Liquids   Fig. . BTE and BSEC improvements by oxygenated nano-additives .benzaldehyde toluene crotonaldehyde are considered by Gowthamand Prakash  which were reduced by . . . and. with CB  GeO  ppm at peak load condition.Based on Table  review data approximately for all nanoparticle ad-ditives UHC CO and soot decreased signicantly while for the NOxemissions it has different treatment and in some cases NOx is increased.So it is very important parameter to nd suitable nanoparticle addi-tives. For the NOx reduction AlO  GNP  CNT and CeO . for the CO reduction AlO CNT . GNP  GO  CeO  for UHC re-duction CeO -. AlO  GNP  MnO. GO  CNT . for soot smoke PM reduc-tion AlO  . FeO  CNT  CeO are the most suitable nano-additives. Following some of thereasons mentioned by the researchers are discussed.Chaichan et al.  reported . NOx reduction by aqueous alu-mina additives and its reason was referred to several factors water highevaporation temperature which was absorbed from the combustiontemperature the high thermal capacity of water and the existence ofnanoparticles. Fig.  shows the emissions of diesel engine whenusing CNT and CeO nano-additives. CNT has the minimum values ofCO NOx and HC emissions . Dhinesh et al.  also studied theFig. . BTE improvements by CoO nanoparticles emissions of CeO nanofuel in different dosage as depicted in Fig. .They found that enhanced caloric value reduced viscosity and in-creased surface area capability of the Nano additive had key roles inemissions reduction where smoke emission dropped down to ppm. Also oxygen vacancy capability and oxidizing agent of ce-rium oxide were mentioned as other reasons for NOx and HC emissionreductions.Dobrzynska et al.  mentioned that NOx emissions dependstrongly on the temperature. When HC and CO emissions are reducedby an increase in combustion temperature NOx generally increasesdue to the increased reaction rate of chemical reactions involving oxy-gen and nitrogen. They concluded that ferrocene had better resultsthan CeO because it acts as a preventive agent against soot build-upin the exhaust system .... NOxNitrogen oxides are mainly composed of nitric oxide NO and nitro-gen dioxide NO. By adding further oxygenated materials to the dieselfuel the amount of NOx concentration will increase. Velmurugan et al. reported that NOx emissions with nanoparticles additives was. where for the pure diesel it was .. Chacko et al.  describedthat less NOx was formed for the GNP compared to GO due to lowercombustion temperature caused by shorter ID which allows less fuelto be burned in the premixed combustion phase . Mei et al. found the same treatment which low temperature in the cylinder de-creased the NOx for the CNT nanoparticles which advanced the ignitiontiming and reduced the amount of mixture in the premixed combustionand caused a slight decrease in the cylinder temperature. Zhang et al. also mentioned lower temperature as the main reason of NOx re-duction for CNT also they added a secondary reason as DF-CNT gener-ates more uniform spray eld due to its lower viscosity and thermaldiffusivity and third reason of NOx reduction was due to a form of ele-mental carbon which can probably act as a deoxidizer during combus-tion . Based on their study CeO nanoparticles had a catalystfunction which were converted between CeOCe and CeOCe CeO helps to oxidize unburnt fuel compositions while theCeO deoxidizes products and reduces NOx .Sahoo et al.  presented another reason for NOx reduction whenusing CuO additives. These nanoparticles acted as heat sink which ab-sorb the generated heat and hence maximum temperature inside thecombustion chamber reduces and caused to less NOx emissions.Gumus et al.  observed that AlO and CuO nano-additives increasedthe NOx because of oxygenated additives enhanced the combustion andmake higher combustion temperature and consequently higher NOx\\x0cM.

NOx emissions of gasoline engine also were reduced whennano particles were introduced to fuel. . and . reductionof NOx were obtained with gasoline-ethanol- ppmMnO andgasoline- ethanol- ppmMnO respectively .Water contents in the fuels such as emulsion fuels or water injectioncan reduce the combustion temperature and consequently NOx will de-crease. Saeddin Ardebili et al.  observed that NOx emission re-duced by . when increasing the fusel oil content from  to due to higher water content of fusel oil and lower heat release ratesand in-cylinder pressure . Higher oxygen content in the fuels withCeO  TiO ZrO  ZnO  additives caused higher temper-ature within the combustion chamber and increased the NOx .Janakiraman et al.  found that TiO had more NOx reduction thanCeO and ZrO due to the presence of nanometal oxides that can providemore oxygen vacancies followed by more reactive oxygen which pro-motes soot oxidation. Kumar et al.  stated that zinc oxide increasedthe combustion average temperature due to improved caloric valuewhich leads to greater oxygen in the blend to react leading to lowerNOx emissions. Actually ZnO absorbs the oxygen for the NOx reduction.... COCarbon monoxide appears due to the incomplete combustion of fos-sil fuels especially diesel fuel. Most studies shows increasing of the ox-ygen content by combining the oxygenated fuels causes furtherdistribution of the CO  while with the presence of oxygen inblended fuels higher cetane value tends to reduce CO emissions .Mei et al.  revealed that the multilayer tubular structure of CNTcan store the extra oxygen so reduce the CO . DF-Ce was betterFig. . Emissions comparison for CeO and CNT .\\x0cM. Hatami M. Hasanpour and D. JingJournal of Molecular Liquids   Fig. . Emission from engine exhaust using CeO additives .for the reduction of CO emissions than that of DF-Ce due to largerspace between the two limits . Iron oxide also decreased the COdue to its decomposition in the combustion process to discharge ironand oxygen atoms into the reaction zone . Graphite particles in-creased the CO because it was a form of carbon having no oxygen mol-ecules in it . CuO reduced the CO emissions due to more reduction ofthe ignition delays time which leads to more complete combustion. By increasing in carbon content of CNT blends CO increased dueto increasing in the oxygen during combustion . Higher surface tovolume ratio of CNT that improves ignition characteristics was men-tioned as the main reason of lower CO compared with CeO .Dhinesh et al.  presented that CO emission was reduced due tothe addition of the cerium oxide nanoparticle which acts as an oxidationcatalyst and increased the evaporation and mixing rates. Akram et al. showed that Ce.Co. nano-composite oxide reduced more effec-tively CO emissions compared with CeO due to shorter ignition delayperiod better carbon combustion and optimum air-fuel mixing effect. Also the same reasons were mentioned for the lower CO emissionsof graphene oxide nanoparticles . Among metal-oxide nanoparti-cles considered by Abulut et al.  the presence of AlO mostly in-creased the oxygen content of the blends which ensured the mostreduction in CO emission for BAlO test fuel in all engine loads.Then BTiO and BSiO followed to BAlO respectively .... UHCUnburned hydrocarbon or UHC is one of the main pollutants pro-duced from incomplete combustion. Like the CO adding the oxygenatedmaterials to the diesel fuel increases the HC amount. When the enginetemperature comes down all air pollutant amount especially HC de-creases signicantly . But lower local temperature and oxygen con-centration in the cylinder makes incomplete combustion andconsequently higher emissions of PM HC and CO . Mei et al. pointed out that great thermal conductivity of CNT is favorable tomake complete combustion of the fuel and reduce the HC emissions.Zhang et al.  introduced the catalytic reaction of CeO as the mainreason of HC reduction while Soukht Saraee et al.  and Sheriffet al.  mentioned that CeO provides more oxygen for the oxidationof the hydrocarbon and transformed it into cerous oxide CeO and re-duce the UHC. Other researchers also mentioned reasonable effects ofnano-additives for the HC reduction. For instance CuO nanoparticle en-hanced the surface-area-to-volume ratio and allows more fuel to reactwith the oxidizer and reduced the HC . MnO acted as a nano-catalyst for gasoline complete combustion and decreased UHC by. and . using gasoline-ethanol- ppmMnO andgasoline-ethanol- ppmMnO blends . CNT reduced the HCamount due to signicant shortened ignition delay and improved com-bustion characteristics . But in some studies such as  CNT\\x0cM. Hatami M. Hasanpour and D. JingJournal of Molecular Liquids   Fig. . Soot area occupation ratio and smoke amount emitted by diesel-CeO nanofuel .caused increase in HC due to existence of carbon in its structure. SiOalso decreased the HC amount by . . . and .for the B BTiO BALO and BSiO respectively .Kumar et al.  found that presence of nano additives acts as a binderand avoids the undesirable fuel collection and crevice area penetrationthus decreases the HC emissions.... Soot PM smokeSoot PM and smoke form due to incomplete combustion so improv-ing the quality of combustion and the high heating value of fuel resultedin high combustion temperatures inside the combustion chamber andsignicantly reduced the emitted particles . Dhahad et al.  andChacko et al.  mentioned the smoke reduction reason as the avail-ability of oxygen molecules for improved oxidation of soot particles inthe combustion zone for AlO and GO as fuel additives respectively.Mei et al.  observed that addition of nanoparticles especially CNTincreases the heat transfer coefcient between the fuel and air whichpromotes fuel evaporation and makes the formed mixture more uni-form. They revealed that soot was generated by the thermal crackingof fuel under high temperature and anoxic conditions . Zhanget al.  found that CeO can oxidize particulate matters by consumingsome HCs before convert to PMs through dehydrogenation and carbon-ization mention. They declared that PM will be formed by the dehydro-genation and carbonization of unburnt fuels at high temperature andlow oxygen conditions. Furthermore their study showed that CNT im-proved spray and lower combustion temperature and acts as the nu-cleus for the formation of particulate matters .As seen in Fig.  soot area occupation ratio of CeO-diesel is mean-ingfully lower than diesel fuel. Also smoke emissions of CeO andCeO were reduced by . and .. Liu et al.  stated thatthis was due to replacement effects of oxygen in CeO crystal whichcan accelerate the diffusion and oxidation of fuel molecules effectivelypromoting fuel chain reaction. Other reasons presented by researchersfor the smoke and soot reduction by nano-additives are high catalyticactivity owing to its high surface-area-to-volume ratio  oxygen en-richment reduces the ignition delay leads to higher burning rate andshorter combustion duration  and increased evaporation rate andimproved fuel-air mixing resulting in shortened ignition delay and en-hanced oxidation rate ... Exhaust Gas Temperature EGTBecause the exhaust gas temperature has signicant effect on the ex-haust emissions it is investigated by many researchers during theirstudies. EL-Seesy et al.  noticed that the addition of GO to biodieselreduced the EGT by improved the combustion process. Kumar et al. reported that addition of nano sized CeO particles to fuel makesa reduction in the delay period so more energy will release during thepremixed combustion phase and cylinder temperature will increase aswell as the in-cylinder pressure . GO nano-additives increased theEGT because of increasing the heat release rate due to the improvementin the combustion process by increasing the oxygen of the fuel blends. Also CuO increased the EGT due to combustion improved .Perumal et al.  showed that EGT of diesel was low as compared toBCuO and BCuO because of CuO addition in PME increasesthe heat release rate due to the complete combustion by oxygenatingbehavior of the fuel blends . As presented in Fig.  from CeO raised the EGT related to the enhanced fuel injection higher utili-zation of oxygen by the CeO promoted the burning process enhancedthe peak temperature so improved the EGT. El-Seesy et al.  foundthat reduction in the EGT with increase of AlO concentration level pro-ceeds until certain dose then EGT begins to rise again. Finally Kumaret al.  revealed that adding the nanoparticles will reduce the igni-tion delay and increase the cetane number of the fuel so a signicantpart of the combustion completes before Top Dead Centre TDC. Thisbetter combustion will reduce the exhaust temperature of nano-fuel... Vibration and noiseThere are some studies focused on the vibration and noise effects ofblended fuels such as nano-additives fuels. Velmurugan et al. Fig. .

Vibration level and Noise level with TiO AlO and SiO nanoparticles .introduced the biodiesel as one of the current trends in the develop-ment of reducing the environmental pollution and annoying noise andvibration which affects the health of the engines and operators .Yaar et al.  reported that nanoparticles addition into diesel fuel de-creased both vibration and sound pressure level and observed thatDTiCuN and DTiCeA had better results in terms of vibrationand sound pressure level . In another study low n-Alumina concen-tration had limited max.  noise values . Generally as depicted inFig.  when the engine load increased vibration and noise values alsoincreased up to the engine load of . Nm and then decreased for allnanoparticle additives ... Corrosion in engineAlthough no direct study was found which focused on the corrosioneffect of nano-fuel on engines but some researches conrmed thatnano-particles prevent the deposition of carbon and iron in cylinderthus the friction of different parts of the engine reduces and conse-quently decreases the corrosion and increases the engine power .. Nanoparticles type as fuel additivesAs described in previous sections nanoparticles are widely used byresearchers as fuel additives due to their amazing characteristicswhich are categorized here. Kumar et al.  and Khond et al.  asshown in Fig.  categorized these functions to oxygen buffer highersurfacevolume ratio micro-explosion property anti-wear and corro-sion high thermal conductivity and catalytic activity. Furthermoremore lubrication and more swirl and turbulence in the fuel are alsomentioned for nanoparticles duty in the literature .Table  shows the effect of nanoparticles on the thermal propertiesof nanofuels. In some cases signicant effect on the properties were ob-served while in several samples no changes were reported.

The mechanism of oxygen supply by cerium oxide which leads to reduced emissions of UHC soot and CO.  Oxidize CO by utilizing cerium oxide.  Oxidation of the soot particles using CeO.  CeO acts as a catalyst which provides more oxygen to accelerate the combustion reaction .  Cerium oxide CeO adsorb oxygen which breaks NOx into simple nitrogen  .  CNT act as a deoxidizer during combustion thus prohibit the formation of NOx.

In their study HVO addition reduced the density of the fuelmixture and consequently decreased the engine power and increasedBSFC. Naja  revealed that adding nano articles to the biodiesel-diesel blends will increase the cetane number and decrease the ignitiondelay. Abulut et al.  indicated that metal-oxide based nanoparti-cles increased the viscosity cetane number and heating value of biodie-sel. Literatures conrms that nanoparticles are not the only additiveswhich changed the fuel property alcoholic additives also modify fuelscharacteristics powerfully. For example rs et al.  revealed thatButanol strongly affected some of the important properties of fuelblends such as density kinematic viscosity and ash point. Table reaction mechanism of most usedsummarize the chemicalnanoparticles.In next section and based on above sections the most used nanopar-ticles CNT CeOCeO AlO GOGNP and TiO in nanofuel applicationare shortly reviewed for their properties and behaviors... CNTsCNTs improved the cetane number and burning rate of the fuel byacting as a catalyst. Actually CNT has been introduced as anenvironmentally kind additives due to its free-metal and enhancementthe thermal conductivity . CNT had an advantage of improved sprayand lower combustion temperature which reduced all emissions ex-cept PN compared with CeO . Also combustion characteristics ofCNT nanofuel had a radical reduction of combustion pressure thus low-ering the formation of NOx . Another reason of CNT NOx reduction isits higher premixed combustion heat release rate and complete com-bustion . Also CNT caused shorter ignition delays and better com-bustion characteristics in the combustion engine . Finally higherthermal conductivity of CNT nanoparticle improves the evaporationrate of water particles in the emulsion fuel during the pre-mixed com-bustion period and reduces the IDP which result is improved engineperformance ... CeO-CeO CeriaNatural oxygen content promotes cerium oxide as a catalyst to burncompletely and rapidly which produce higher BTE and lower BSFC .Cerium oxide CeO  state becomes constructively transformed tocerous oxide CeO state via low-energy reaction during the ox-idation of the hydrocarbons. CeO has lower emissions because it hashigher reaction rate due to its larger surface area . Ceria reduced\\x0cM. Hatami M. Hasanpour and D. JingJournal of Molecular Liquids   CO and HC emission due to improved ignition characteristics. But it in-creased NOx due to increase in combustion temperature . AlsoCeO makes more active free radicals such as O H and OH which pro-motes the chain reaction and improves the fuel burning rate and com-plete combustion . CeO reduces the ame temperature comparedto CNT which consequently reduces the NOx emissions . The ce-rium oxide CeO reacts with hydrocarbon and reduced it to form ce-rous oxide CeO water vapor HO and carbon dioxide COacting as an oxidation catalyst and thus providing oxygen to the fuelwhich CO gets converted to carbon dioxide . Furthermore ceriumoxide supplies oxygen for the reduction of hydrocarbons as well assoot oxidation to form cerious oxide ... AlOGenerally AlO acts as a perfect combustion catalyst to reduce thepollutant emissions while improving the combustion behavior. Aluminaincreases the in-cylinder pressure and decreases the ignition delay .The addition of aluminum oxide yielded better results in engine powerbecause of promote an increase in oxidation rate and a decrease in igni-tion temperature . Aluminum oxide reduced the HC and CO emis-sions due to more shorten ignition delay and improved ignitioncharacteristics of nanoparticles. Also CO concentrations increasedwith adding aqueous N-Alumina to diesel due to reductions in CO andHC concentrations . Alumina has the ability to interact with waterat high temperatures producing hydrogen which in turn promotesfuel combustion . Furthermore alumina nanoparticle exhibitslower BSFC value as compared to CNT due to the presence of higher ox-ygen content in its structure . Many of researches revealed alumi-num oxide is efcient nano-additives for emissions reduction... GOGNPA compacted multilayer of D sheets usually up to  layers iscalled GNP while GO is used for a multilayer of graphene with oxygenfunctional group in its structure . Inert nature of graphene avoidsit from chemical reactions with other materials. The graphite can besuspended and dispersed in inter molecular gaps of the fuel dropletsmight cause a bit easier slip of the adjacent layers by reducing the kine-matic viscosity . GOGNP improves the combustion process andrises the cylinder pressure which improves the combustion tempera-ture and consequently increases the NOx emissions . Additionallyhigh thermal conductivity and high surface area of GO improves com-bustion and increases the cylinder pressure . GO nanoparticles de-velops the combustion where a balance between CO and CO formsi.e. when CO emission decreased CO formation increased . Actu-ally larger surface area of GO increases the chemical reactivity so de-crease the ignition delay and improve the combustion for COreductions. GO nanoparticles increase in the cetane number and reducethe kinematic viscosity of the fuels . Also these additives reducedthe combustion duration and increased the average mean temperaturesignicantly so leading to an increase in NOx emission but reduced theCO and UHC emissions . More studies such as  used GO forthe emissions reduction. GO nanoparticles increased the cetane numberof biodiesel fuel and decreased the specic fuel consumption SFC ofthe blend consequently. Physically oxygen existence in the GO-nanoparticle structure enhances combustion and makes higher brakepower and lower SFC . GNP additives enhanced the carbon oxida-tion rate due to efcient combustion process and reduction in BSFC.Also these additives reduced the burnout time and minimized the latecombustion duration in the exhaust stroke so it decreased the incom-plete combustion that caused fuel-rich combustion products ... TiOTiO in the nanofuel acts as an oxidation catalyst which offers moreoxygen to the burning fuel inside the cylinder resulted in excellent com-bustion and reduced the CO emissions formation . Activationenergy generated by the TiO nanoparticles burned the deposited car-bon particles and reduced the HC emissions . BTE of the doping ofTiO-SiO blended fuels was greater than that of the diesel due to thehigh heat release rate. But NOx amount was increased because of highercylinder peak pressure early injection timing and shortened ignitiondelay .TiO nanofuel also provides high surface energy due to itslarge surface to volume ratio which accelerates the combustion process. TiO reduced the HC emission due to the complete combustion be-cause of surplus oxygen molecules present in its structure . TiO hadhigher BTE as compared with pure fuel due to the event of oxygen bufferand very energetic TiO nanocatalyst. It assists to have faster burningrate during the combustion procedure by thermal energy obtainedfrom novel nanocatalyst and produce economic fuel atomization .. ConclusionIn this review study recent and novel nano-fuels in engines were an-alyzed and discussed. Different nanoparticles added to diesel bio-dieselgasoline alcoholic and blended fuels were investigated in the results ofemissions and BSFC reduction as well as the engines efciency improve-ments. Following main points can be concluded Nanoparticles have different functions such as oxygen buffer highersurfacevolume ratio micro-explosion property anti-wear and corro-sion high thermal conductivity and catalytic activity. Furthermoremore lubrication and more swirlturbulence in the fuel also werementioned for nanoparticles duty in the literature. AlO CuO CNT and CeO are the mostly used nanoparticles for dieseladditives. FeO TiO and MnO are the frequently used nanoparti-cles in SI engines application. CeO TiO CNT and AlO are the com-monly applied nanoparticles as additives to bio-diesel fuels. CeO GOAlO CNT and TiO are the most used nanoparticles additives to die-selbiodiesel blended fuels.

Future studiesBased on this review study and concluded main points followingsuggestions can be presented for future studies- Because a single type nanoparticle cannot present all the benets forinstance AlO was very efcient for emissions reduction while CeOhad the better BSFC reduction so using hybrid nanoparticles suchas AlO-CeO can ll this gap which is ignored.- Based on this review additives to gasoline engines are not widely\\x0cM.

Hence it is imperative that ICEs are improved in order to reduce the local and global environmental impact of transport. This paper considers the scope for such improvement after discussing the basic principles that govern engine eciency and the technologies to control exhaust pollution. The great scope for such improvement is illustrated by considering various practical approaches already in the market. For instance the best in class SI engines in the U.S. have  lower fuel consumption compared to the average. Engine and conventional powertrain developments alone could reduce the fuel consumption by over  for light duty vehicles LDVs. Implementing other technologies such as hybridisation and light-weighting could reduce fuel consumption by  compared to the current average for LDVs. Current after-treatment technology can ensure that the exhaust pollutant levels meet the most stringent current emissions requirements. Indeed with the most modern diesel vehicles the exhaust can be cleaner than the intake air in urban centres. The implications for transport policy particularly where there are plans to ban ICEs are considered in the nal discussion. All available technologies need to be deployed to mitigate the environmental impact of transport and it would be extremely short-sighted to discourage further development of ICEs by limiting their sales. .

Currently transport is almost entirely   . powered by combustion engines land and marine transport runs on reciprocating internal combustion en- gines ICEs while air transport is dominated by jet engines. Combustion engines also full important roles in industry and power generation. Liquid fuels have become the energy source of choice for transport because of their high energy density and because they are easy to trans- port and store. For instance at normal temperatures and pressure the volumetric energy density of gasoline is around  times and  times higher compared to hydrogen and natural gas respectively. A vast global infrastructure for the manufacture and distribution of liquid fu- els which will be expensive and dicult to replace or replicate has been established over the past century or so. Transport and petroleum crude oil are very closely linked  currently around  transport energy is provided by liquid fuels made from petroleum and around  of crude oil is used to make transport fuels - . Table  shows the share in demand of transport energy across dif- ferent transport sectors  it is to be noted that aircraft and land and marine freight transport account for  of global transport energy de- mand  . Around  of global LDVs are powered by spark-ignition SI engines using gasoline  while the freight sector is dominated by compression ignition CI engines running on diesel fuel. Marine trans- port mostly uses residual fuel oil RFO though a large fraction of RFO is also used for domestic and industrial heating. The global demand for transport energy is large - Table  shows the average daily demand for transport fuels for the third quarter of   . The rst column shows the demand in barrels of oil equivalent BOE. An exajoule   Joule is equivalent to . million BOE and assuming a volumetric energy density of . MJl for gasoline  MJl for diesel and jet fuel and  MJl for residual fuel oil the fuel volumes used are shown in the last column. Thus the world uses on average over  billion litres of gasoline diesel and jet fuel daily . This demand is growing with the growth expected to occur almost entirely in devel- oping non-OECD economies and is expected to be around  higher in  compared to  - . The demand for energy for freight transport and aviation is expected to grow faster than for lighter vehi- cles because of the greater opportunity for improving fuel eciency and for electrication in the light duty sector     . Hence the demand for diesel and jet fuel middle distillates is expected to grow faster than for gasoline     . Currently there are many initiatives across the world to develop al- ternatives to ICEs and petroleum-based conventional fuels driven by concerns about climate change and local air quality associated with transport because of emissions of CO   particulates nitrogen oxides NO x  carbon monoxide CO and hydrocarbons HC. Indeed criti- cism of ICEs is common in the news media and amongst some politi- cians in many countries and has led to a belief that the elimination of ICEs is desirable and imminent. Of course transport policy is also in- uenced greatly in many countries by the desire for economic growth energy independence and energy security. The ICE could be replaced by a battery or a fuel cell while the alternatives to conventional fuels include biofuels natural gas hydrogen synthetic fuels electro-fuels liquid petroleum gas LPG and methanol     . However all these alternatives start from a very low base and face signicant barriers to rapid and unrestrained growth. Such alternatives need to be assessed on the basis of life-cycle analysis and there will be severe environmental economic and social consequences if alternatives are imposed prematurely  . For instance there is great current in- terest in electrication of transport but there are dierent degrees of electrication and the need for an ICE is only eliminated by a battery electric vehicle BEV. However the GHG impact of BEVs could be worse compared to conventional vehicles if the electricity generation and the energy used in battery manufacture which depends on battery capac- ity and can be large is not suciently decarbonised. In many grow- ing economies such as China and India coal will play a substantial role in power generation for decades to come and the carbon intensity of power generation will be too high for BEVs to be benecial from a GHG consideration. Indeed in such countries even emissions of particulates NO   will be worse for BEVs though they will be displaced away from the vehicle. In several other countries despite signicant increases in renewable power generation the dispatchable power needed to meet demand during EV charging periods will today largely be met with generating capacity powered by natural gas. When this electricity is generated from gas turbines GHG emissions from BEVs are comparable to emissions from current ICE-powered vehicles. x and sulfur dioxide SO In addition there are very signicant human toxicity implications associated with the mining of metals needed in batteries  which cannot be ignored as the number of BEVs grows. Large engines in com- mercial transport and aircraft cannot be run on batteries because of the size of the batteries required  . At the end of  the world had around . million BEVs   in  around . million BEVs and plugin hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs were sold of which around were BEVs giving a total of approximately . million global BEVs at the end of      . More than half of them were sold in China      which would actually have worsened the global GHG impact of transport. Indeed policy on BEVs in China is being driven by the need to gain a technological lead in new energy vehicles  and concerns about urban air quality rather than GHG considerations. So by the end of  global sales of BEVs amounted to around . of global LDV sales and the global stock of BEVs was just under . of total LDV numbers. A hundred-fold increase by  in BEV numbers compared to  would bring their number to around  million roughly  of global LDV numbers which would account for around  of transport energy since LDVs use around  of transport energy  Table  . Even under the unrealistic assumption that all these  million BEVs were made with carbon-neutral energy and run on carbon-free electricity at best around  of transport-related GHG would be saved by such an enor- mous increase in BEV numbers. In any case such a massive increase in BEV numbers will require very large prior investments in charging infrastructure additional electricity generation nancial incentives to encourage the sale of BEVs and recycling of batteries  which may not be aordable in most countries. The supply and cost of metals needed particularly of cobalt to support such a large spread of BEVs could also be very challenging. Similarly any increase in the share of biofuels hy- drogen or other energy sources for transport will face signicant chal- lenges  . Hence most credible projections suggest that even by  - of transport energy will still come petroleum based liquid fuels       . Thus for decades to come global transport will be predominantly powered by ICEs using petroleum-based fuels. It is imperative that the eciency and environmental impact of such engines are improved in or- der to bring about any signicant and realistic improvement in the sus- tainability of transport. In fact there is great scope to bring about such improvements in the short term with better combustion after-treatment and control systems and in the medium term with the development of new fuelengine systems. The vast existing transport infrastructure can be used to support such initiatives without requiring too much change or investment. This paper discusses the scope for such improvements particularly for the short and medium term. In the long term as the \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al.

However rst we briey consider the ex- isting engines and fuels and the mechanisms that limit eciency and aect emissions. also because they are dicult to control. HCCI-like combustion with low NO x and soot and high eciency but which is easier to control can be ensured by not fully premixing fuel and air. Such premixed-enough combustion systems are discussed in Section  . . Current IC engine combustion systems and fuels Several books - discuss engine combustion systems and fuels and this section contains a brief summary. .. Engine combustion systems Land and marine transport are powered by two major engine com- bustion systems. Most light duty engines run on spark Ignition SI engines and use gasoline fuel. Combustion is initiated in a SI engine by an electric spark and fuel energy is released as a ame propagates through a mixture of fuel and air that is compressed after premixing. In modern SI engines x emissions operated at lambda   stoichiometric CO HC and NO in the exhaust are reduced to acceptably low levels through the use of a three-way catalyst. The numbers of nanoparticles less than  nm in diameter are of increasing concern though particulate mass is very low in the exhaust of a SI engine. Gasoline particulate lters GPFs are likely to be required in the future to tackle these particulate emissions. SI engined vehicles on average convert only - of fuel energy to motive power mainly because of the requirement of throttling at low loads and knock      at high loads  the principles are discussed in greater detail in Section  . However their impact on pollution and air quality is low because of the use of eective after-treatment. Larger SI engines such as those required for commercial vehicles also have to run at low speeds would be more prone to knock on a given fuel because there is more time available for chemical reactions leading to knock and their eciency would be reduced. Hence SI engines are not usually used in commercial transport requiring large engines. In compression ignition CI engines fuel is injected into the high- pressure and high-temperature environment near the top of the com- pression stroke and heat release is initiated by autoignition as the fuel mixes with oxygen. Currently all practical CI engines use diesel fuel  they are diesel engines. Soot particulates and NO x emissions are a signicant problem for diesel engines. Technology such as complex after-treatment and high-pressure injection systems are needed to con- trol them. Hence modern diesel engines are much more expensive com- pared to SI engines of similar size but are more ecient compared to SI engines. There has been much recent interest in homogeneous charge com- pression ignition HCCI combustion. In a HCCI engine fuel and air are fully premixed as in a SI engine but heat release occurs by autoignition as in knock in a SI engine. The thermal eciency of HCCI engines is very high but they are constrained to operate at lean mixture strengths and hence low loads because of excessive pressure rise rates at richer equiv- alence ratios. Friction losses are proportionately higher at lower loads and the brake eciency of HCCI engines at the loads they can oper- ate will be lower. HCCI engines are not practical for this reason and .. IC engine fuels Gasolines need to have high anti-knock quality as specied by RON and MON the Research and Motor Octane Numbers or the Anti-Knock Index AKI  RON  MON     . Most market gasolines have RON   and a MON value about  lower than the RON value. Fuel requirements of SI engines are discussed in greater detail in  . For diesel fuels autoignition quality is measured by the Cetane Number CN. Diesel fuels generally need to have a high CN because they need to autoignite easily practical diesel fuels have CN  . The higher the RON of a fuel the lower is its CN and vice versa     . The cetane number of jet fuel is lower than that of conventional diesel fuel and it is blended using more volatile components than are found in the diesel boiling range. Marine transport fuels are blended from the heaviest com- ponents in the fuel pool and have a high sulfur content. Marine engines could be forced to run on conventional diesel fuel because of current moves to reduce the sulfur content of marine fuels further contributing to the increase in demand for conventional diesel fuel in the future. Gasoline-like fuels are dened in this paper as fuels with CN   or RON   i.e. in the gasoline autoignition range as in  . The rst step in the manufacture of practical transport fuels is the dis- tillation of crude oil. Gases dissolved in the crude oil are released when oil is heated above ambient temperature and make up Liquid Petroleum Gas LPG. Up to  of the crude could be LPG which consists mostly of propane and some butane. The fraction in the gasoline boiling range with boiling points between  C and  C from the initial dis- tillation is known as Straight Run Gasoline SRG. Diesel fuels are made up of heavier components with boiling points in the range of  C to  C. Heavy components with boiling points higher than C could constitute  of the weight of petroleum depending on the source of the crude oil. In the renery these heavy components are rst cracked  into smaller molecules which are further processed to produce useful products e.g. by reducing sulfur or by changing their octanecetane number. The products in the gasoline boiling range from dierent parts of the renery are collectively known under the generic term naphtha  which is usually processed further to increase its oc- tane number it is also used in the petrochemicals industry. Other non- petroleum components such as biofuels and high-octane components like methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE are blended with renery com- ponents along with some fuel additives to meet the required fuel speci- cations     . . Engine and vehicle eciency  main principles .. Introduction It has long been known that high compression ratios and weak or fuel-lean mixtures improve the eciency of SI engines but since  SI engines have invariably been constrained to operate with stoichio- \\x0cF.

With weak mixtures the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide CO and unburned hydrocarbons UHC is straightforward x  a mixture of the challenge is the elimination of nitrogen oxides NO NO and NO   as a chemically-reducing environment is needed. If the mixture is suciently weak then combustion temperatures will be too low to form NO x  but to meet current emissions regulations these mix- tures would not necessarily be ammable in a conventional engine. In x traps LNT were introduced and these use ma- the late s lean-NO terials such as barium carbonate to react with the NO x . However regen- eration is needed to convert the barium nitrate back to barium carbonate during rich mixture excursions. In any case the trapping eciency was only about  and as emissions legislation became more demanding these technologies were no longer adequate and lean burn operation had to be again abandoned. The challenge of reducing NO x emissions in an overall weak mixture is also applicable to diesel engines and this has led to Selective Catalytic Reduction SCR that uses an aqueous urea solution . by mass of CNH   that  O to generate ammonia NH x . Such systems have become widely used reduces about  of the NO in diesel engines since  and could be readily applied to SI engines. More information on these technologies and their development can be found in texts such as Heywood  and Stone   with some of the more recent trends discussed later in Sections . and .   It is also well known that combustion needs to be rapid so as to em- ulate the instantaneous heat addition of the so-called Otto cycle analy- sis and repeatable if there are cycle-by-cycle variations in combustion then ignition can only be optimised for the mean cycles. The key loss that needs to be eliminated is from throttling since this means of re- ducing the air ow increases the pumping work loss. Options for this include cylinder de-activation control of the piston stroke as in the original Atkinson engine or closing the inlet valve mid-stroke of the pis- ton as originally proposed by Miller for limiting the maximum cylinder pressure in diesel engines. Whether inlet valve closure is early or late the theoretical performance is the same and has the result of reducing the eective compression ratio. However an air standard cycle model  can be used to show that the expansion ratio  r e  is much more important than the compression ratio  r c   c   c   e   c     e     e    c    e . where  is the ratio of heat capacities and  is the ratio of temperature rise during heat addition to the temperature at the end of compression.

The signicance of Eq. . is shown in Fig. . where it has been as- sumed that the temperature rise associated with combustion is  K and the ratio of heat capacities is held at . with an initial temper- ature of  K. If the compression ratio is half of the expansion ratio then the loss of eciency will only be a couple of per cent noting that the air standard cycle analysis predicts almost double that which might be achieved and this compares with a reduction in pumping mean ef- fective pressure PMEP of order . bar that might represent almost  of the output of the engine. Air standard cycle analyses ignore the real thermodynamic performance of the air fuel mixture and combus- tion products and dissociation. The importance of these is discussed in Section . . A simpler way of reducing the pumping loss that can be applied with three-way catalysts is to employ Exhaust Gas Recirculation. Up to  is viable and it makes little dierence whether this is dened on a vol- umetric gravimetric or molar basis and this could lead to a reduction in PMEP of about . bar. However EGR will slow combustion and in- crease the level of cycle-by-cycle variations in combustion so mitigation by increasing in-cylinder motion is important. Another strategy to reduce part load losses is to downsize the en- gine this means supercharging the engine either directly or with an exhaust powered turbine so that a reference operating torque on the road-load curve corresponds to the engine operating at a higher engine load than it would with the intake at ambient pressure. However this is almost certainly associated with a reduction in compression ratio so as to avoid combustion knock at full load and this imposes an eciency penalty across the whole operating envelope. It is of course much better if part load operation is eliminated and this is possible with hybrid engine vehicles most simply but not e- ciently with a series hybrid or to a large extent with shunt transmission systems and these are discussed in Section . . .. Real thermodynamic behaviour of combusting mixtures The air standard Otto cycle analysis uses the properties of air at am- bient conditions and an idealised heat input. Tizard and Pye  were the rst to consider the real heat capacity of the reactants and products and the signicance of dissociation. Fig. . shows their computation of Fuel-Air cycle eciency for weak mixtures including the eects of dissociation. Also included in Fig. . are the results of the Fuel-Air cy- cle calculations reported by Taylor   with perhaps not surprisingly \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    Fig. .. Experimental measurements of a natural gas fuelled engine with a fast burn combustion system operating at  rpm and a  compression ratio with MBT ignition timing  . The exhaust chemical energy is expressed as a percentage of the input fuel energy. signicant dierences not least since the Taylor data have not included the eects of dissociation. Pye  subsequently noted that in the s there was very limited data on the high temperature heat capacity of gases and equilibrium constants but even in the s  the val- ues of the equilibrium constants do not agree well with current values. None the less this early work explained why the observed indicated ef- ciencies were much lower than predicted by the Otto cycle analysis and why maximum power occurs rich of stoichiometric and why weak mixtures give a higher indicated eciency. Another way of quantifying the impact of dissociation is to calculate the caloric value of the car- bon monoxide and hydrogen in the exhaust of an engine operating with stoichiometric combustion  this energy content amounts to - of the fuel caloric value. So weakening the mixture increases the ideal cycle eciency but as Fig. . shows there are competing factors that will reduce the e- ciency namely an increase in the level of cycle-by-cycle variations in combustion an increase in the emissions of partially burned fuel and an increase in the duration of the main combustion period. In a natu- rally aspirated engine operating at full load there would be a reduction in the mechanical eciency as the mixture is weakened since the lower output makes the mechanical losses more signicant. However if the engine is supercharged perhaps driven by an exhaust turbine then the output can be maintained and to a rst order the boost pressure ratio will need to equal the lambda for example a boost pressure ratio of . for a lambda of . as will be seen later in Fig. . . As soon as lambda . is reached there will be negligible carbon monoxide  in  the  exhaust  and  the  eciency  increases  until  lambda reaches . just after which there is a rapid rise in the hydrocarbon emissions and cycle-by-cycle variations in combustion. For the very weak mixtures lambda above . ame propagation is slower but more signicantly the ame is more readily quenched. The increase in burn duration is not signicant so long as ignition timing is optimised a  MFB duration of  crank angle ca amounts to a -point loss of eciency and even if this is doubled to ca the loss of e- ciency is only -points. The valves do not operate instantaneously at Fig. .. The eect of dilution by air solid line and EGR broken line on the cycle eciency and boost requirement for a xed load. As with the fuel-air cycle eciency calculations the assumptions are for adiabatic and reversible compression and expansion with instantaneous heat input at top dead centre. The Taylor  prediction for eciency dotted line does not include the eect of dissociation. the end of the stroke and this means that the eective compression and expansion ratio will be around  with about a -point loss of e- ciency. At a lambda of . the Fuel-Air cycle would imply an eciency of . compared with the experimental value of . so the biggest loss that has not been plotted in Fig . is of course heat transfer that will account for about a -point loss of eciency. Heat transfer has been reduced in diesel engines by thermal swing coatings      but with SI engines if there is less cooling then there is an increased likelihood of combustion knock. However auto-ignition can be exploited in Gaso- line Compression Ignition GCI engines as discussed in Section . . It is also pertinent to compare dilution with air with dilution by EGR and some results from modelling are presented in Fig. .  and like the data in Fig. . this is for a compression ratio of  and a xed engine out- put. The data in Fig. . is from a phenomenological model  that has been constrained to operate adiabatically with instantaneous com- bustion so as to replicate fuel-air cycle modelling. As expected Fig. . shows that dilution by air increases the cycle eciency and the initial increase is rapid since the impact of dissocia- tion is reduced and for weaker mixtures the ratio of the heat capacities is increased. The increase in eciency with EGR is perhaps unexpected in this context  it is unlike part load operation when the EGR will re- duce the throttling loss. The eciency has increased with EGR dilution because the lower cycle temperatures lead to lower levels of dissociation and there is small increase in the ratio of the heat capacities. The boost requirement for the xed power density with dilution rises less rapidly than the dilution factor because of the rise in eciency. These ideal cy- cle analyses have been for adiabatic compression and expansion and it might be thought that the lower combustion temperature will reduce heat transfer. This is of course true but to maintain a xed power output the in-cylinder pressures will be higher so the heat transfer coecients will increase so the lower combustion temperatures will not necessarily improve the overall eciency. Evaporative cooling of the fuel during the induction in Gasoline Di- rect Injection GDI engines allows a higher compression ratio to be used an increase of about  for a given quality fuel. GDI engines are also more amenable to boosting supercharging or turbocharging since fuel \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    Fig. ..

Boosted engines require a reduced compression ratio but do enable the steady-state road load at cruising speeds to be at a part load condition that is un-throttled. Engine optimisation for vehicles cannot be separated from the transmission system and this is discussed further in Section . . .. Performance of high eciency current market engines ... Stoichiometric spark ignition engines There are two current macrotrends in the development of conven- tional high-eciency SI engines  adoption of larger naturally aspi- c  and smaller lower com- rated Atkinson or Miller cycle engines  r pression ratio downsized-boosted engines. As explained previously the former seeks to enhance eciency using valve timing to reduce pump- ing losses and knocking propensity while maintaining a large r e  while the latter seeks to reduce pumping losses via turbocharging and to re- duce the relative importance of friction and pumping losses by virtue of having a smaller engine that operates at higher loads. e  r An example of the AtkinsonMiller pathway is Toyotas spark igni- tion engine with a  brake thermal eciency   it is a naturally aspirated . L in-line four cylinder engine with a maximum power out- put of  kW that uses  RON fuel. It uses a long stroke to improve the volume to surface area ratio and a high turbulence intensity allow- ing increased levels of EGR for a given level of combustion stability. As a long stroke increases the frictional loss at a given engine speed and reduces the volumetric eciency there is a trade-o and this engine has a bore of . times the stroke. The frictional losses are minimised by reducing the mass of the reciprocating components using a variable displacement oil pump a low viscosity oil SAE W- and careful control of coolant temperature with an electrically driven pump. To op- timise the part load fuel economy then an Atkinson cycle is used with a compression ratio reduced to . from  to reduce the trapped volume without so much need for throttling. A very comprehensive benchmarking of the engine   provides enormous detail on the engine operating regimes. The engine operates with stoichiometric mixtures for most of its envelope and the peak e- ciency  occurs with  cooled EGR and a brake mean eective pressure bmep of just over  bar at a speed of  rpm the mixture is only enriched for the highest speed and load conditions. Fig. . shows the eciency contour map when the engine was independently tested with an EPA Tier  fuel AKI of . As well as reporting the brake eciency there are contour plots of inlet valve opening and closure exhaust lambda valve overlap EGR level and ignition timing  . A good example of the downsized-boosted pathway is provided by Hondas recent .L turbocharged direct-injection engine  . Like the Toyota engine the Honda engine features a long-stroke design and var- ious eciency enhancing features such as sodium-lled exhaust valves for knock mitigation and dual cam phasing for optimizing EGR and pumping losses.The corresponding brake eciency contours measured by the U.S. EPA are shown in Fig. . . Notice that at lower torque levels below say  N-m the eciency of the Honda engine exceeds that of the Toyota  even though the peak eciency of the Toyota engine is higher this observation still holds true though to a lesser extent when the engines are scaled to provide the same peak power. At higher torque levels and low-to-moderate speeds the Toyota has superior eciency. Thus we anticipate that the best engine with respect to fuel economy will be dependent on the relative frequency of high- and low-load driv- ing as well as the specic powertrain system the engine is paired with. Other factors will also impact the choice of engine technology including low-speed torque mass and size and noise and vibration. A logical further step toward improving engine eciency would be to combine the naturally aspirated AtkinsonMiller pathway with the turbocharged pathway   as exemplied by the Audi TSFI and the VW EA engine series. These engines have demonstrated signicant fuel economy benets over the previous turbocharged versions  in the case of the TSFI the fuel consumption map was signicantly improved over an earlier downsized boosted engine with a smaller displacement  . Although the engines described above are technology rich there are additional technologies that can be applied to signicantly enhance e- ciency while maintaining stoichiometric operation  recent reviews can be found in - . One example which has been deployed in numer- ous production engines since   and achieved a market penetra- tion of approximately  of new light-duty trucks sold in the U.S. is cylinder deactivation. Deactivation has also been successfully applied to small three- and four-cylinder vehicles including the VW engine men- tioned above. By deactivating the valves of one or more cylinders at lower loads it is possible to simultaneously reduce both engine friction as well as pumping and heat losses. In larger engines the fuel consump- tion benet can exceed    while in the highly ecient engines discussed above the benet is estimated to range between  and       Cylinder deactivation can also be used to help maintain catalyst tem- perature during periods of prolonged low load operation making this technology particularly synergistic with lean combustion systems. \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. ... Lean and dilute SI engines Section . demonstrated the desirability of operating with lean or dilute intake charge to achieve high eciency. Current engine technolo- gies all use EGR-dilution as discussed above to reduce pumping losses at lower loads and to mitigate knock at higher loads. Consequently a great deal of engineering eort is expended to expand EGR tolerance though either improved in-cylinder ow motion      or with ad- vanced ignition systems - . The overwhelming advantage of EGR- diluted combustion systems is that they allow use of inexpensive highly eective exhaust gas after-treatment  described in more detail below. Lean-burn engines on the other hand oer potentially higher ecien- cies  cf Fig. .  but require more expensive NO x after-treatment. Under the current emissions regulations this has limited their application to premium vehicles. Recently however Mazda has introduced a lean-burn engine into the  European  market  that  does  not  require  expensive  NO x  after- treatment. The engine features a high compression ratio of . which enables very lean low-load combustion using a weakly stratied spark- assisted compression-ignition combustion strategy. Here a spark initi- ates a ame similar to a conventional SI engine but the pressure and temperature rise in the unburned gases as combustion proceeds rapidly pushes the unburned gases into autoignition. At mid- to high-loads EGR is added to maintain low peak combustion temperatures pressure rise rates and NO x emissions while at the highest loads the engine runs as a stoichiometric SI engine  with knock control assisted by high levels of EGR fuel injection during the compression stroke and tailoring of in-cylinder fuelair distribution and hence the end-gas mixture compo- sition. By incorporating additional fuel economy enhancements due to careful thermal management low viscosity oil and friction reduction a vehicle equipped with this engine achieved approximately a  and  reduction in fuel consumption  over the New European Driving Cycle and Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure WLTP respectively as compared to a comparable model equipped with a nat- urally aspirated Atkinson-cycle engine  . The U.S. EPA estimates  that a fuel consumption improvement of . is expected over the U.S. regulatory cycle when only eciency gains associated with the lean combustion process are considered. Cylinder deactivation is also applicable to lean combustion technolo- gies and has several benets  including extending the stable op- erating range of lean homogeneous combustion and maintaining high exhaust gas temperature  a particularly important advantage for lean exhaust gas after-treatment. Transportation Engineering    combustion techniques   it is apparent that there is signicant po- tential remaining to reduce the fuel consumption of the current diesel passenger car eet while meeting legislated emissions levels. .. Powertrain performance To best exploit the high-eciency regions of the engine speed-load maps  Figs. . and .  the engine must be paired with a transmission system with a wide ratio range. Shunt transmission systems see Fig .  can use an epicyclic gearbox to introduce a parallel transmission path and this can incorporate a variable ratio drive. As the shunt transmission is a linear system its overall speed ratio can be expressed as o    i   e   v . v is greater than R The epicyclic gear ratio  R e  is xed but the variable ratio drive  R v  can vary such that if the ratio is numerically equal there is a geared neu- tral. This means that the engine can be rotating yet the wheels would not be rotating so there is potentially an innite range of overall gearing ratios. The system can also be inverted so that the wheels are rotating but the engine is stationary. When R e then reverse is obtained. The variable ratio drive can be obtained mechanically with any Continuously Variable Transmission CVT or as in the Torotrak sys- tem which incorporates a shunt transmission system to give an Innitely Variable Transmission IVT system  . The variable ratio drive can also be achieved electrically if a pair of electrical machines is used such that some power is shunted electrically. This concept dates back to the s in the Thomas transmission system   and is well suited to hy- bridisation as the electrical machines can also be connected to a battery - as in the Prius  . Hybrid engine vehicles whether series parallel or shunt enable the engine to be turned o when low power say below  kW is required. The Toyota Prius introduced in  has a hybrid shunt transmis- sion that is referred to as a Dual System to distinguish it from the more familiar Series and Parallel systems  . Fig. . shows how a shunt transmission system in this case the Toyota Prius Dual Hybrid can lead to a low fuel consumption for a wide range of power outputs over the complete speed range. The engine had a maximum brake eciency of  so with automotive SI engines now achieving eciencies of over  then a  gkWh bsfc island should be achievable. For low power requirements the engine would be turned o and stored electrical energy would be used. ... Diesel engines .. Modelling for high eciency engines As discussed in Section .  in diesel engines the fuel is injected near the top of the compression stroke and for conventional high CN fuel it autoignites nearly instantaneously. The compression ratio is not lim- ited by knock and high compression ratio coupled with lean operation and minimal pumping losses due to un-throttled operation results in very high eciency. Limits to diesel engine eciency are generally as- sociated with trade-os between eciency and emissions  particularly NO x . A comprehensive review of how engine design and operating pa- rameters impact diesel engine eciency can be found elsewhere     . Despite their already high eciency new diesel engines continue to steadily improve. An example is found in the recent introduction of the Mercedes-Benz OM  engine family  . Combustion system im- provement based on a stepped-lip piston geometry  and higher peak cylinder pressure capability allows higher EGR rates to be used and combustion to be advanced leading to higher eciency while re- specting the after-treatment systems NO x reduction capabilities. Cou- pled with lower heat losses and continued improvement in friction re- duction a reduction in fuel consumption of approximately  was achieved over the previous engine family even while power was in- creased by nearly . Based on this example as well as demonstrated potential for brake thermal eciencies as high as  using advanced It would be remiss not briey to mention engine modelling. Ad- vances in modelling capability have led to signicant improvements in engine eciency through an increased understanding of the processes undergone in an internal combustion engine. Modelling of course com- prises a vast topic including -D -D and -D simulations commonly known as computational uid dynamics CFD. The models themselves however many dimensions they are implemented in are numerous and linked but from a modelling perspective are essentially independent elds - combustion modelling turbulence modelling turbulence chem- istry interactions ow modelling and mixing sprays break-upprimary and secondary droplet evaporation droplet drag and heat transfer to name but a few. A good overview can be seen in the recent book by Onorati and Montenegro   some useful review articles can be read in      and examples of some applications in     . . Control of exhaust emissions Exhaust emissions from vehicles broadly fall into three categories local pollutant gaseous local pollutant non-gaseous and other pol- lutants. Each of these categories has their own control techniques which can dier between engine types. The next two sub-sections will discuss \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al.

Table  Summary of main emissions from vehicles and their typical control techniques.

Gasoline emissions control Gasoline engines have been tted with catalysts for emissions control since the s  . These were initially introduced to remove CO and UHCs from exhausts in response to smogs which were common in the USA then. In the s the Three-Way Catalyst TWC was introduced to add control of NO x . ... Local pollutants gaseous Today the dominant control for all gaseous engine local pollutants is still the TWC. Rood et al . in their recent review of TWC technology  give a comprehensive overview of the state of the art. Gaseous local pollutant emissions from modern gasoline vehicles mostly occur in the rst tens of seconds of engine operation before the catalyst has reached its conversion temperature  . As a result modern TWCs have sig- nicant storage capability for both NO x and CO enabling capture of these pollutants at cold-start and subsequent conversion once the cata- lyst has reached its optimum operating temperature  . TWCs require the engine to be operated with close to a stoichiometric AFR  this is to avoid the presence of oxygen in the exhaust. Lambda is therefore tightly controlled on todays SI engines and removing this constraint provides a signicant opportunity for the potential increases in e- ciency required of gasoline engines. TWC development today focuses on the reduction in precious metal requirements and hence cost and reduced light-o temperatures and storage performance     . One further area of development necessary is high temperature performance currently enrichment is often necessary at high engine loads and speeds in order to limit the exhaust temperature and protect the catalyst this has clear eciency and particulate emissions penalties. TWC robustness to high-temperature will need to be improved in order to exploit these potential eciency and emissions improvements  . Other pollutants can be emitted from gasoline and diesel engines that are not currently regulated such as ammonia NH   which is emitted today in higher lev- els from agriculture and is a signicant source of secondary particulate formation and nitrous oxide N  O an ozone depleter and extremely potent greenhouse gas. Currently levels of these are very low but mon- itoring and research continues     . ... Local pollutants non-gaseous The main non-gaseous local pollutant from SI engines is particulate matter PM. This consists of solid and liquid phase particles and arises predominately from inhomogeneities in the fuel-air mixture during com- bustion  . Liquid phase particles are typically unburned hydrocar- bons and can move between gaseous and liquid phases as conditions in the exhaust change. Solid phase particles are typically carbon with ad- sorbed hydrocarbon species. A signicant amount of research has been \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    undertaken on PM formation and control measures which shows typi- cally that GDI engines have higher PM emissions compared to port fuel injection PFI engines  . Gasoline composition can also play a sig- nicant role in the level of PM emissions  . Engine out emissions control has proven surprisingly eective at PM reduction increased in- jection pressures and injector design have consistently decreased PM emissions over the last decade  . For liquid phase particles the TWC is an eective control technique  these particles being removed by the TWC as UHCs. For solid and liquid phase particles the Gasoline Par- ticulate Filter GPF has been shown to be highly eective in reducing PM emissions from gasoline vehicles typical ltration eciencies are in the range - depending on design and particle size  . Going forwards it is likely that high-eciency GPFs will be tted to gasoline vehicles eectively removing PM emissions from them. .. Diesel emissions control Diesel engines typically produce higher levels of emissions on an engine-out basis than gasoline engines because of the unsteady diu- sion ames inherent in diesel combustion. This unsteady heterogeneous combustion process is typically globally lean and this lean combustion is one reason for diesel engines higher eciency than gasoline however this excess of oxygen is also a challenge for diesel NO x after-treatment systems. The heterogeneous combustion while globally lean has locally rich regions which lead to higher particulate matter formation on an engine out basis than gasoline engines. However the excess of oxygen typically leads to very low levels of CO and UHC emissions. ... Local pollutants gaseous Similar to the TWC tted to gasoline engines the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst DOC has proven eective at removing UHC and CO from diesel exhaust. Further development of these catalysts today mirrors that of TWCs with focuses on low temperature conversion and reduction in precious metal requirements  . NO x removal from diesels has been an area of intense focus particularly because a TWC cannot typically be used on diesels as their lean operation means a TWC would not be x . In common with all other pollutants NO eective in reducing NO x can be controlled using both engine methods such as combustion sys- tem design exhaust gas recirculation or calibration or after-treatment. On all modern vehicles the two approaches are used together. A modern x Trap LNT which can after-treatment system would include a Lean NO x at low temperature and a Selective Catalytic Reduction sys- store NO tem SCR which can reduce NO x at temperatures higher than  C. SCR systems are complex and expensive requiring an aqueous urea so- lution also known as AdBlue or Diesel Exhaust Fluid - DEF injection upstream of the catalyst  and hence a separate tank and injection system for the DEF. An SCR is typically followed by an Ammonia Slip Catalyst ASC in order to remove any ammonia required for the SCR reaction from the engine exhaust. A comprehensive overview of NO x reduction in after-treatment can be seen in Piumetti et al .   and Johnson et al.  . In common with all other catalyst technologies current develop- ment includes reducing the precious metal requirements and reducing light-o temperatures. Additionally for NO x reduction combinations of technologies including more than one SCR as well as an LNT are being considered in order to meet the most stringent legislative requirements. ... Local pollutants non-gaseous As with gasoline engines the main local pollutants non-gaseous from diesel engines are PM. On an engine-out basis these are typically an order of magnitude or so higher than those from gasoline engines however since the early part of this decade almost all diesel engines have been tted with a diesel particulate lter DPF. These lters have very high  ltration eciency but need to be regenerated peri- odically with an associated penalty on CO  emissions due to the high fuel consumption required to reach the high temperatures needed for regeneration. DPFs have also been combined with SCR as SCR on lter Table  NO x emissions from ADAC RDE tests   Car RDE NO x mgkm Audi A  TDI BMW d Steptronic BMW d Touring BMW X xDrive d Citroen Berlingo BlueHDI  Honda Civic . i-DTEC Kia Ceed .

The use of a DPF creates a pressure drop in the exhaust which does increase CO  emissions marginally for vehi- cles tted with them. Future development of DPFs focusses on reducing this pressure drop as well as other improvements around ltration ef- ciency. These improvements notwithstanding the introduction of the DPF has eectively removed particulate emissions from diesel vehicles. As a result of this intense focus on diesel engine emissions todays diesel engine after-treatment systems can be very complex for example one system to meet Californias most recent proposed standards includes in order from engine out to tailpipe SCR-ASC-LNT-DOC-DPF-SCR-ASC  with both a close-coupled SCR for cold-start and a larger SCR sys- tem for warm operation. Such systems while complex and expensive can achieve near zero emissions at tailpipe for all diesel pollutants. .. Real driving emissions In Europe there has been a requirement since September  and the introduction of the EUdtemp legislation for not only laboratory tests for exhaust emissions measurement but also so-called Real Driv- ing Emissions RDE testing. Such testing introduced after the diesel- gate scandal   uses portable emissions measuring systems PEMS attached to the tailpipe of a vehicle to measure its emissions on road under real  conditions. Legislatively compliant test routes include an urban portion a rural portion and some highway driving. Such test- ing is intended to ensure that cycle-beating and illegal activities such as those performed in the dieselgate scandal are not possible. In addition to legislative RDE testing a substantial amount of inde- pendent RDE testing is being undertaken today as well. These tests do not drive the legislative RDE cycle but use similar cycles also repre- sentative of real  driving. ADAC Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil- Club conducted tests of  new diesel vehicles in  their results are shown in Table   . All but one of the vehicles ADAC tested had very low levels of NO x emissions in their testing with ve emitting less than  mgkm and the Mercedes Cd emitting  mgkm. At the time of writing  vehicles tested by Emissions Analytics an indepen- dent RDE tester achieve their highest possible rating of A  indicating emissions lower than . gkm NO x  over an RDE test  . Of these   are diesel and  are gasoline of which  are hybrids and  are plug-in hybrids  all but one of the ADAC vehicles tested met this standard as well. This shows that today all internal combustion engine technologies are capable of near-zero NO x emissions although clearly not all are. The presence of DOCs only on diesel vehicles up until the intro-  monitored at roadside loca- duction of Euro  led to an increase in NO x from a diesel engine has a low fraction tions. Typically engine-out NO   unless very high levels of EGR are employed      however of NO the proportion of NO x emitted at tailpipe is increased by the presence of a DOC  .

How- NO x after-treatment technolo- ever the eectiveness of SCR and other NO gies has led to real improvements in AQ measured at the roadside with a recent paper noting The proportion of NO x now being emitted directly from road transport as NO  is up to a factor of two smaller than the esti- mates used in policy projections.   and  exhaust after-treatment has   in recent years from light led to substantial reductions in emissions of NO duty diesel vehicles which has contributed to reduced roadside NO  concen- trations   . There are signicant developments taking place to improve the ef- ciency of SI engines almost to the level of diesel engines - . In preparation for the discussion below it will be useful to dene the base- line vehicle to use as our point of comparison. A convenient choice is the U.S.  passenger car new vehicle average in the U.S. which has both fuel economy performance and weight characteristic that are well documented  . This average vehicle has a real-world fuel economy rating of . mpg . L km. Considerable improvement over this baseline has already been clearly demonstrated  for instance fuel consumption for the best-in-class passenger car in the U.S. market of similar size and performance is already  lower  . .. Long-term opportunities and trends Given the capability of modern well-designed after-treatment sys- tems which can allow vehicles to emit zero pollutants where are the next opportunities and challenges for after-treatment Going forward durability is going to be a key requirement EU species a vehicle life of  km. Globally California LEV III species  km by  and China b  km by . In the heavy duty sector CARB are in discussions to extend durability requirements to  miles  . Such requirements will clearly ensure further improvements in local air quality globally. These requirements however place signi- cant demands on after-treatment systems where thermal aging and ash build up can aect both conversion and ltration eciencies of all l- ter and catalyst technologies. However in parallel with these legislative drivers the innovation of catalyst technologies continues and there is every expectation that these durability requirements will be met  . Engine manufacturers are having to reconsider the balance of engine- out vs. after-treatment control techniques. If large and complex after- treatment systems are required to meet legislative requirements then it can be cost eective to reduce any engine-out reduction technologies such as EGR or high fuel injection pressures and rely solely on the after- treatment system  particularly in heavy-duty applications. There is often conict between local pollutant removal and eciency requirements. As engine eciencies have increased exhaust gas temper- atures have been decreasing as would be expected lower heat rejection is a consequence of higher eciency  . Such a decrease in exhaust temperature reduces the energy available to heat the catalyst and may delay catalyst light-o. Stop-start and other technologies have a similar eect. Similarly the pressure drops over complex after-treatment pack- ages reduce engine eciency. Future vehicles will require careful ther- mal management as well as improvements in after-treatment to mitigate these. Further eciency improvements in gasoline engines may require a departure from stoichiometric operation  . As a result gasoline after- treatment systems may begin to resemble diesel after-treatment systems as it is likely that SCR would be required for NO x conversion in lean gasoline operation  . The increasing hybridisation of vehicles and electrication brings new challenges. For example engines may not switch on for the rst  or  miles of operation in a PHEV and frequent stop-start events will mean that keeping temperature in catalysts amongst other areas of a vehicle system will be very important. Electrically heated catalysts may form part of the solution  potentially the catalyst could be warm before an engine even switches on this may also remove the need for storage catalysts. Further integration with system thermal management  e.g. battery cooling and cabin HVAC may bring further synergistic benets. . Scope for improvements in eciency and emissions .. Short to medium term opportunities ... Engine technologies In the short-term eciency improvements will be associated with the increased penetration of technologies that are already proven to be viable for commercialisation as these technologies become more broadly accepted and cost-eective. Cooled EGR integrated exhaust manifolds variable valve lift variable geometry turbochargers cylinder deacti- vation and variable compression ratio are some example technologies among others. Neither the benets nor the costs of adding multiple tech- nologies are additive and the many studies      -  which es- timate both fuel eciency gains and costs often conate improvements due to advances in ICEs with improvements associated with aerodynam- ics rolling resistance vehicle mass and the like. Nevertheless  the  potential  fuel  economy  benets  from  applying proven ICE technologies alone can be estimated with the U.S. EPAs Lumped Parameter Model  . Exercising this model against an av- erage  vehicle with a technology mix appropriate to a  mpg real-world fuel economy rating we nd that the current best-in-class vehicle in the U.S. market is predicted to lower fuel consumption by   in reason- able agreement with the number cited above. Adding additional tech- nologies specic to ICE powertrain improvement turbocharged Atkin- son additional friction reduction improved  V accessories startstop continuously variable valve lift which includes cylinder deactivation and an -speed automatic transmission  the potential fuel consump- tion reduction rises to over . As a second point of calibration vehicle-level improvements bet- ter aerodynamics rolling resistance mass etc. can also be considered achieving a total fuel consumption reduction of . This compares favourably with estimates recently provided by Argonne National Lab- oratory  of up to  when adjusted to our baseline vehicle. Approaching the medium-term additional technologies may be ap- plied that have not been considered above. Although the Mazda SkyAc- tivX discussed earlier is a successful introduction of a lean burn tech- nology at a reasonable cost advances in ignition systems may make lean combustion systems more accessible and cost-eective. By allow- ing mixtures suciently weak that the NO x emissions are inherently low lambda less than about  a pre-chamber combustion system can give a greater eciency benet than when diluting with EGR see Fig. .  while avoiding or minimizing expensive after-treatment. Pre-chamber systems have been developed on a number of occasions and recent work in this area includes that of Mahle  and IAV  . The Mahle pre- chamber system and some brake eciency data are shown in Fig. . . In the Mahle system some fuel is admitted to the main cylinder by port fuel injection but additional fuel is injected into the pre-chamber and this is also where the spark plug is located. Upon ignition combust- ing gases leave the pre-chamber as a series of jets that can then ignite the very weak mixtures in the main chamber. The volume of the pre- chamber is about  cm   and the fast burn allows a high compression ratio  to be used. It can be seen in Fig. . that brake eciency of over  is obtained over a wide operating range and that the bmep is high  this depends on having an eective turbocharger system. Current eorts to improve ICEs are focused on using existing market fuels. This is clearly essential because it is very dicult to change both fuels and engines simultaneously in the market place. Fuel does not have to be injected into the pre-chamber and the per- formance of these passive  pre-chamber ignition systems is discussed in great detail by Sens et al .  who show that the operating range is \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    Fig. .. The Mahle pre-chamber system and some brake eciency data  S. narrower than for an active pre-chamber system but that its fuel econ- omy can be comparable to an active pre-chamber. a modern exhaust catalyst and intelligent management of combustion temperatures and modes     . Another technology that can provide signicant improvements in the eciency of conventional SI engines is water injection either into the intake port or  more eectively  directly into the cylinder     . Evaporative charge cooling associated with water injection can increase power density by increasing intake charge density as well as reduce knock  enabling a higher degree of downsizing higher compression ratio or more advanced combustion phasing. Each of these latter fac- tors will also increase eciency. It also lowers exhaust gas temperature reducing the need for charge enrichment which likewise increases e- ciency. When applied to a state-of-the-art boosted Atkinson cycle engine water injection was able to provide an additional - fuel consump- tion improvement depending on the drive cycle investigated  . An additional improvement of about  also depending on the drive cy- cle could be obtained if the compression ratio was increased to take advantage of the improved knock resistance. Like water injection variable compression ratio engines have yet to see signicant penetration into the mainstream market despite their po- tential for a sizeable reduction in fuel consumption. Variable compres- sion ratio allows the fuel economy benets at low-to-moderate loads of a high compression ratio engine while maintaining the high power- density benets of a lower compression ratio turbocharged engine. Fuel economy improvements compared with a downsized turbocharged en- gine are estimated to be approximately  and are expected to be largely retained when applied to a boosted AtkinsonMiller engine  . ... After-treatment technologies Similarly after-treatment systems have also developed and continue to develop to reduce exhaust pollutants such as particulates NO x  CO and HC - . For instance modern diesel particulate lters DPFs and gasoline particulate lters almost entirely eliminate particulates from ICE exhausts     . Indeed in some circumstances a DPF may make the particulate emissions in the exhaust so low that they are lower than the atmospheric ambient  i.e. the ICE is actually cleaning the air  . A warmed-up catalyst in a modern car can reduce HC emissions in the exhaust to almost zero  certainly well below ambient x levels in diesels can be air levels in many urban areas  . Even NO reduced to levels much lower than European limits set for  with ... Fuel implications in the short term Engine combustion system developments also have implications for fuels. For instance the design trend in SI engines has been to increase the pressure in the cylinder for a given unburned gas temperature in order to improve power density and eciency. This makes autoigni- tion in the end gas leading to knock more likely. As pressures in the cylinder increase preignition which can lead to extremely high intensity knock known as superknock becomes more likely  and will limit the scope for turbocharging and downsizing. High anti-knock quality of fuels will help to avoid knock and mitigate superknock  and will enable higher eciency SI engines. Pressure to increase the anti-knock quality of gasolines to enable high eciency SI engines will grow. For instance there are suggestions  that by  all gasoline in the U.S. should have RON   whereas currently U.S. regular the most com- monly used gasoline has a RON of around . Whether such a change will bring about benets in GHG needs to be assessed on a life cycle basis and the answer might be dierent for dierent renery congu- rations. This will require big changes and investments in reneries and will further increase the availability of low-octane gasoline components such as naphtha      because the opportunity to blend them in gasoline will decrease. The importance of high-octane components like ethanol MTBE di-isobutylene and methanol will also increase. An important question is how fuel anti-knock quality should be de- ned in such modern engines        because this has major im- plications for fuels manufacture which is geared towards meeting fuel anti-knock specications. Currently gasoline anti-knock quality is de- ned by RON and MON. They are measured by comparing the gasoline with blends of iso-octane and n-heptane known as primary reference fuels PRF in the single-cylinder CFR Cooperative Fuels Research en- gine according to test procedures set by ASTM American Society for Testing and Materials. For practical fuels RON is higher than MON and the dierence is known as sensitivity S. The pressure for a given unburned mixture temperature is lower in the MON test compared to the RON test. Practical gasolines contain aromatics olens and oxygenates which respond very dierently in chemical kinetic terms to increasing pressure compared to PRF which are used to dene the RON and MON scales. Practical fuels are much more prone to autoignition and knock \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    under the MON test conditions compared to PRF. However SI engines have been moving away from the MON test condition as designers have increased the mass of air pressure in the engine without increasing the unburned gas temperature too much in order to increase eciency and power density     . In fact in modern engines a lower MON fuel for a given RON i.e. a fuel that has higher sensitivity for a xed RON has better anti-knock quality       . However in many areas e.g. U.S.A. and Europe MON is considered to contribute to anti- knock quality i.e. high MON is considered desirable. As engine design- ers seek to further improve engine eciency this mismatch between specications and engine requirements will get wider and will have to be addressed. One approach might be to replace the octane scale with a dierent one based on toluenen-heptane mixtures toluene reference fuels TRF rather than PRF. The fuel would be tested in the RON test and assigned a toluene number TN the volume percent of toluene in the TRF that matches it for knock  . At the very least countries which specify gasoline anti-knock quality by RON alone like Japan should not introduce a minimum MON specication. In addition to knock conventional fuel-related concerns such as ig- nition ame development deposit formation and control  and pol- lutant formation will continue to be of importance as SI engines seek ever higher eciency. There is persistent pressure to reduce sulfur lev- els in both gasoline and diesel to enable eective after-treatment sys- tems. Fuel additives      are routinely used to control deposits in the fuel system. Alternatives to conventional petroleum-based liquid fuels such as biofuels  hydrogen  natural  gas   both  as  compressed  natural  gas CNG and liquid natural gas LNG synthetic fuels methanol liquid petroleum gas LPG ammonia dimethyl ether DME and electrofuels are being actively developed  . Often energy security or the desire to reduce petroleum imports rather than the control of GHG is the main driver for such developments. Of all these alternatives it is the biofuels primarily as ethanol that are very well established accounting for about . of global transport energy demand. However all these alternative fuels start from a very low base and though their use will grow face sig- nicant barriers to unlimited and quick growth as transport fuels  . Most credible projections      suggest that alternative fuels would not account for more than - of global transport energy by  this is still a very large change since  of transport energy represents over . billion litres of conventional liquid fuels every day. At the same time the use of such alternatives makes sense somewheresometime and hence their use will grow. .. Medium to long-term opportunities Medium- to long-term approaches to improved engine eciency that are being developed include compression ignition approaches that use market gasolines      although there is scope to develop aord- able and highly ecient new fuelengine systems to meet the increas- ingly stringent requirements on GHG emissions and local air quality if engines are not conned to using current market fuels. Such systems would be able to leverage GHG benets from fuel manufacture by using fuels primarily made up of low-octane gasoline components that are less processed and hence have a lower carbon footprint. Such fuels are also likely to be in surplus and hence could be cheaper than conventional diesel or high-octane gasoline. Of course this will require cooperation between auto and oil industries and other stakeholders and will prob- ably happen in the mid to long term. Some of these possibilities are discussed below. ... Gasoline compression ignition GCI The gasoline direct injection compression ignition engine is similar to the Mazda system discussed above in that it can use market fuel but it does not rely on spark ignition and partial combustion via ame propagation to achieve autoignition and to control combustion timing. Premixed compression ignition has demonstrated diesel-like eciency  using U.S. market gasoline but has additional advantages associ- ated with its lower engine-out emissions. Soot formation can be elimi- nated in CI engines if the fuel and air are suciently premixed before combustion then exhaust gas recirculation EGR can be used to re- duce temperature and oxygen content to minimize NO x  . Modern diesel engines use high-pressure injection systems to promote premixed combustion but even then have to use sophisticated after-treatment sys- x to acceptable levels making tems to bring down exhaust soot and NO them very expensive. GCI engines are simply diesel engines running on gasoline-like fuels. The high ignition delay of such fuels allows much more time for the fuel to mix with air in the cylinder and makes it much easier to control soot and NO x . Moreover the RON of the fuel can be much lower than that of current gasolines. The advantages of the GCI concept are a The engine will be at least as ecient and clean as current diesel engines but will be less complicated and hence cheaper lower in- jection pressure simpler after-treatment because the focus shifts to controlling CO and HC rather than soot and NO x . b The optimum fuel will be less processed and hence easier to make compared to current gasoline or diesel fuels. c It provides a path to mitigate the global demand imbalance between heavier and lighter fuels that is otherwise projected. The alternative is investment in reneries to make the required diesel and jet fuel while the diesel engine continues to be expensive in order to meet increasingly stringent NO x soot requirements. d It reduces investment requirements by reneries and ensures more ecient renery operation by providing a home for homeless hy- drocarbons      . The concept has been well-demonstrated in research engines but de- velopment work is needed to make it feasible on practical vehicles e.g. on cold start. Signicant progress has been made in this regard to develop the GCI concept using U.S. regular gasoline. In addition to the high eciencies described below well-to-wheel analyses show that when combined with a  RON fuel the GHG footprint of a GCI engine will be lowered by approximately an additional   associated with the lower energy demands for fuel manufacture     . When GCI is compared to an equivalent diesel engine the GHG impact of such a GCI engine would be around  lower with the benet coming primar- ily from fuel manufacture. The most advanced demonstration of a GCI engine is associated with Sellnau and co-workers        who have developed and tested a prototype multi-cylinder engine. The engine features a compression ratio near  fast intake air heaters to aid in cold-start and combus- tion phasing control a stroke-to-bore ratio near . a  bar capa- ble fuel injection system and a -step exhaust cam to enable exhaust re-breathing for low-load operation. At loads above  bar the engine uses a double injection strategy whereby the second injection controls combustion phasing and pressure rise rate but burns in a largely non- x and soot emissions are expected to premixed mode. Accordingly NO be considerably higher than for conventional SI combustion systems. When operated without EGR the engine provides a peak brake e- ciency of . with a broad range of speeds and loads above  see Fig. . . The light load performance is also extremely good. At  rpm and a load of about  bar BMEP a highway moderate speed cruise condition the BSFC is between  gkW-h correspond- ing to a thermal eciency approaching   a number that compares favourably with modern diesel engines. With EGR the benet will be a few percent lower but as shown in Fig. . the modelled fuel con- sumption on the US combined regulatory test is reduced by over  compared to their baseline vehicle  compared to our baseline vehi- cle. Placing this in perspective using the Lumped Parameter Model this is an improvement of  over a stoichiometric SI engine incorporat- ing a comparable level of technology. With potential further advances mainly associated with heat loss reduction GenX and by coupling to \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    Fig. ..

V mild hybridisation an estimated reduction in fuel consumption of nearly  is obtained. An alternative strategy for operating a GCI engine is to premix the fuel and air completely before combustion occurs as in a HCCI engine. However this creates challenges with meeting the required speed and load range since the requirement for fuel autoignition quality or igni- tion delay ID in CI engines varies with pressure and temperature in the engine. For instance high ID in the fuel would be desirable at high loads when soot formation is a problem while at low loads when au- toignition is dicult a low ID will be benecial. One way to meet these challenges and to enable rapid combustion phasing control is to adopt an injector concept that allows tailoring of fuel reactivity by metering in small quantities of an ignition enhancing additive. With this strat- egy power densities exceeding conventional diesels    bar bmep can be achieved while respecting noise constraints  and the emis- sions problems associated with non-premixed combustion are avoided such that it may be possible to operate without a particulate lter and with minimal NO x after-treatment. A map of brake thermal eciency measured using this strategy is shown in Fig. . . In comparison with Fig. .  we see both higher peak thermal eciency and a broader area where brake thermal eciency exceeds . In the important regula- tory cycle area between  and  rpm and  N-m of torque the premixed strategy should deliver an additional  reduction in fuel consumption over the GenX Delphi engine. With additional mea- sures taken to increase eciency such as were applied to the GenX and Fig. .. Brake thermal eciency measured for a premixed GCI concept  . The torque axis was developed assuming a displacement of . L such that the peak torque curve shown underestimates the demonstrated potential of this concept. mild hybridisation we expect the fuel economy to rise to approximately  mpg and  mpg is within reach with full hybridisation. This repre- sents a  reduction in fuel consumption compared with our baseline the  U.S new car average. ... Reactivity controlled compression ignition RCCI Reactivity Controlled CI RCCI is another way to meet the require- ment of varying ID at dierent operating conditions - . In the RCCI concept a fuel with high ID such as a market gasoline or ethanol      or natural gas  is injected in the port and ignition is triggered by the direct injection of a fuel such as commercially avail- able diesel fuel with low ID near top dead centre. Depending on the engine operating condition the ratio of the two fuels used is changed e.g. relatively more diesel fuel is used when autoignition is dicult as at low loads. However the amount of diesel fuel used is around  of the total fuel used over a normal operating cycle. In an approach similar to the second GCI strategy described above RCCI could also be imple- mented using one fuel a market gasoline on board but reducing its ID by using varying amounts of a diesel ignition improver and inject this reactive fuel rather than diesel fuel to trigger ignition  . RCCI com- bustion can have very high indicated eciency near zero levels of NO x and soot and acceptable pressure rise rate and noise over a wide range of engine loads  . RCCI requires two fuel injection systems which will increase the cost and complexity. Heavy-duty engines are already more expensive and the incremental cost will be smaller in percentage terms. The chances of misfuelling could also be reduced in eet oper- ations with centralized fuel provision. Hence RCCI is probably better suited for commercial eet operations. Widespread adoption of RCCI in heavy-duty engines should help moderate the expected increase in demand for diesel fuel. ... Octane on demand OOD Many of the technologies discussed above for increasing SI engine ef- ciency in the short-term were aimed at improving the knock resistance of the engine. However high octane is usually needed in SI engines only in a small fraction of the engines operating region - . Octane on demand OOD makes the best use of available fuel octane quality. The engine carries a high and low-octane fuel and will have two fuel injection systems. These components can come from separation of the single gasoline currently available at the pump      or separately sourced and stored on the vehicle  . Such an approach allows the engine to be redesigned e.g. higher compression ratio to improve ef- ciency     . Alternatively with the same compression ratio the engine can use the high-octane fuel only a part of the time when it \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    is needed and low-octane fuel for most of the operating regime. Since low-octane fuel has a lower carbon footprint there will be an overall re- duction in GHG on a well-to-wheel basis even if the engine compression ratio is not increased     . Both GCI and RCCI engines would also benet from an OOD system as the low octane fuel would assist with low load autoignition while the high-octane fuel can extend the range of high-load operation. ... Opposed piston engines Opposed piston engines are older than the automotive industry hav- ing  pistons in each cylinder with  or  crankshafts for each cylinder  and  cylinders with  crankshafts  . When  crankshafts per cylinder are used there is scope for controlling the phasing to in- crease the period for near constant volume combustion. Recent work with -stroke opposed piston diesel engines uses uniow scavenging one piston controls the inlet ports and the other piston controls the ex- haust ports. With no cylinder head there is less heat transfer and this leads to a higher eciency. A brake eciency of  is predicted for a . L  cylinder diesel engine based on a validated model of a . L  cylinder opposed piston engine   the power output is predicted to be  kW at  rpm. A proposal for a light duty engine with a . L displacement has an output of  kW at  rpm and this is compara- ble to a . L conventional engine. The opposed piston engine will be operating with weaker mixtures and this too contributes to the higher eciency of the opposed piston engine  . Work is also being pro- gressed on a -stroke opposed piston gasoline engine  that uses a sleeve valve to control the gas exchange processes. Unlike a conven- tional sleeve valve engine the junk rings and heads will not be needed. Mixture preparation with gasoline will be easier than with diesel fu- elling so there are attractions in using a -stroke opposed piston engine for gasoline compression ignition GCI operation and comparable e- ciency to operation with diesel has been achieved  . .. Long-term opportunities As electricity generation decarbonises further this renewable elec- tricity could be used to manufacture batteries and run BEVs taking their GHG footprint towards zero on a life cycle basis. However as fuel con- sumption of ICEs also decreases as discussed in this paper the GHG impact of ICEs will also decrease proportionately and reduce any advan- tages BEVs running on renewable electricity might have in terms of GHG emissions. In fact the availability of sucient renewable or carbon-free electricity is a prerequisite for other alternatives as well if reduction of GHG is the primary aim. However this is a long-term option given the very large demand for transport energy. For instance there is much interest in electrofuels or e-fuels which can be hydrocarbons  liquid or otherwise - made with CO  and hydro- gen or hydrogen itself. E-fuels will have a very low GHG footprint if they are made using renewable or nuclear energy. Hydrogen could be made from the electrolysis of water and could be used in fuel cells. However the production of e-fuels is very energy intensive and the well-to-wheel eciency of e-fuels is very low. If renewable electricity is available at all for such a purpose the focus should be on e-fuels for aviation which cannot be realistically powered by batteries     . However even replacing only aviation fuel with e-fuels is extremely challenging. In one study the eciency of conversion of renewable electricity to e-fuels is estimated to be   . The current daily global demand for aviation fuel is . exajoules in energy terms  Table  . So the global need for renewable electricity to make sucient e-fuel to replace the current de- mand for aviation is . exajoules or  TWh daily. This means the world will need  GW of continuous carbon-free power generation through each day to meet the demand for aviation fuels. This is equiva- lent to building over  nuclear power stations of  GW capacity the size of the Hinkley Point C power station in the U.K. or around . mil- lion wind turbines of  MW capacity assuming a capacity factor of .. It is very unlikely that globally there is sucient economic or technical capacity to undertake such a vast expansion of carbon-free electricity in the short to medium term. However more and more electricity will be produced when it is not needed as the share of solar and wind electric- ity in electricity generation increases because of the intermittent nature of renewables. This excess electricity could be used to reduce the GHG footprint of the aviation sector to a certain extent by making aviation fuels. Indeed approaches such as e-fuels should be seen as ways to en- able easier expansion of renewable electricity generation rather than a solution to decarbonise transport in the short to medium term. . Conclusion Currently around . of transport is powered by combustion en- gines and around  of transport energy is provided by petroleum- based liquid fuels every alternative starts from a low base and faces very signicant barriers to unlimited expansion. Hence even by   of transport energy is expected to be provided by conventional fuels powering combustion engines. It is imperative that the performance of such engines is improved in terms of eciency and exhaust pollutants if current greenhouse gas emission targets are to be achieved. There is a lot of scope for such improvements as discussed in this paper. In the short-term implementing technologies that have been proven commercially viable in conventional stoichiometric SI engines can lead to an estimated  reduction in fuel consumption over a current typ- ical new car. Additional technologies not considered in reaching this estimate including lean-burn SI combustion water injection and vari- able compression ratio are expected to reduce fuel consumption fur- ther. In the medium term lean-burn technologies incorporating some degree of compression ignition are expected to result in a further im- provement of  such that a fuel consumption reduction associated with IC engine improvements alone approaching  is feasible for en- gines used in light duty vehicles which currently are predominantly SI engines. With hybridisation the high eciency region is greatly ex- tended  Fig. .  and with the high eciency engine concepts that have been described here SI engines may never need to operate with a brake eciency below . The relatively small expected additional benet associated with lean-burn technologies is initially surprising but it must be recalled that the point of comparison is a highly optimized SI engine with low pumping losses and a high compression ratio. One of the key advantages of lean-burn compression ignition technologies is their abil- ity to deliver high eciency without necessarily requiring a high-octane fuel potentially providing additional greenhouse gas savings associated with fuel manufacture as well as helping to balance demand for renery output streams in terms of their eciency and design. New diesel engines show signicant up to  fuel consumption improvement over previous versions which are already very ecient. However they suer from high levels of PM and NO x in the exhaust and require sophisticated and expensive after-treatment. However current after-treatment technologies can deliver extremely low levels of NO x and PM in real-world use  well below the levels required by legisla- tion. In the medium term there is scope to make it easier to control these pollutants using gasoline-like fuels rather than diesel via GCI and RCCI approaches. If a low octane gasoline is used there is further scope for reducing their GHG footprint through GHG savings in fuels man- ufacture. Particulate lters are very commonly used in modern diesel engines and are likely to be required even for SI engines. Exhaust par- ticulates are virtually eliminated when particulate lters are used and other sources of PM such as from tyre and brake wear become impor- tant. If regenerative braking is used as in hybrid electric vehicles brake wear does not exist. The levels of PM from tyre wear will be higher for a BEV because of the higher weight of the vehicle resulting from the weight of the battery when compared to an equivalent HEV using a SI engine. In any case after-treatment technology has developed to ensure extremely clean exhausts both for SI and diesel engines. In summary the fuel consumption and hence the GHG impact of SI engines can be signicantly reduced using existing technology  the \\x0cF. Leach G. Kalghatgi and R. Stone et al. Transportation Engineering    best in class fuel consumption is already around  lower compared to the average. Fuel consumption can be reduced by  through engine development alone and with new approaches using compression igni- tion such as GCI may exceed diesel-like eciencies. Using other tech- nologies like hybridisation and light-weighting fuel consumption could be reduced by  compared to the current average for light-duty SI engine vehicles. For both SI and CI engines exhaust pollutants can be controlled to levels well below the requirements of current legislation. Although some countries have ambitions to remove IC engine vehi- cles ICEVs this will take time even in the light-duty sector as there will be a need for  increased electrical power generation capacity and possibly storage too  changes to the electricity distribution system and  the development of smart charging systems and other infrastructure requirements that will be dierent in dierent countries. It is particularly dicult if not impossible to run heavy duty road marine and air transport which account for more than  of global transport energy demand entirely on electricity because of the very large size and weight of batteries that will be needed. While this change is happening research and development in IC engines should continue because as this paper has demonstrated there is still scope for signi- cant improvements in reducing fuel consumption and emissions. More- over IC engines burning renewable e-fuels can ease the expansion of renewable electricity generation by providing an alternate storage op- tion when generation exceeds demand. Banning the sale of new ICEVs as some countries propose to do will stop needed research and develop- ment well before the deadline for such a ban as manufacturers disman- tle their ICEV operations and will limit options available to renewable electricity suppliers. All available technologies should be developed and used to mitigate the environmental impacts of transport.

Introduction Multi-task learning MTL signicantly pre-dates the deep learning era and it has seen a resurgence in the past few years as researchers have been applying MTL to deep learning solutions for natural language tasks. While steady MTL research has always been present there is a growing interest driven by the im- pressive successes published in the related elds of transfer learning and pre-training such as BERT and the release of new challenge problems such as GLUE and the NLP Decathlon decaNLP. These ef- forts place more focus on how weights are shared across networks evaluate the re-usability of network components and identify use cases where MTL can signicantly outperform single-task solutions. This paper strives to provide a comprehensive survey of the numerous recent MTL contributions to the eld of natural language processing and provide a forum to focus efforts on the hardest unsolved problems in the next decade. While novel models that improve performance on NLP benchmarks are continually produced lasting MTL challenges remain unsolved which could hold the key to better language under- standing knowledge discovery and natural language interfaces.

Multi-task learning MTL is a collection of techniques intended to  improve  generalization  strengthen  latent  representations  and enable  domain  adaptation  within  the  eld  of  machine  learning  . It has been applied to feed-forward neural networks   deci- sion trees   random forests   Gaussian Processes   support- vector  machines    and  most  recently  deep  neural  networks  across a broad range of domains. This includes specic deep learning architectures such as MTL seqseq models  and MTL transformers  . It has been shown that under certain circum- stances and with well-crafted tasks MTL can help models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of different tasks  . It has also been shown however that MTL can be extremely frag- ile and sensitive to both the selected tasks and the training pro- cess which leads to models that signicantly under-perform when compared to the best single-task models  . While MTL has been a subject of research for multiple decades   there still exist a number  of  unsolved  problems  unexplored  questions  and  short- comings in production systems which are addressed within. This survey will present a condensed summary of the large library of current MTL research applied to natural language processing NLP  Corresponding author. E-mail address jworshauccs.com J.

Characterizing multi-task learning MTL introduces additional training objectives to a learning sys- tem to bias the learner with a broader understanding through solv- ing related tasks. The end-goal is to improve performance on a set of primary tasks through the inductive bias introduced by the ad- ditional tasks  . The set of primary tasks are referred to as the target task set and additional tasks  which are used to improve performance  on  the  target  set  belong  to  the  auxiliary  task  set. While this is the standard approach   others have also designed MTL models with no auxiliary focusing on competitively solving all the tasks jointly  . In practice MTL is closely related to Transfer Learning TL   as the goal of each is to improve the performance of a target task or domain through the use of related tasks and domains. A task is dened as a specic operational capability such as Part of Speech Tagging  or  Question  Answering.  Tasks  traditionally  do  not  share the same output features or solution space. A domain is a certain feature space and underlying data generating process. When work- ing with TL and MTL commonly different domains share the same feature space but have different data generating processes. While there is no limit on how much variance can exist in different but related domains a common example in NLP is to treat different \\x0cJ. Worsham and J. Kalita  Pattern Recognition Letters     Table  TL  MTL Task and Domain Categories. Fig. .  Relationship of Machine Learning Concepts with a Focus on Transfer Learning and Multi-Task Learning. languages as different domains  . Both TL and MTL can make use of differing domains and differing tasks. Transfer Learning is broken down into three different categories based on what differs between the source and the target  . If the source and target share the same task with different domains this is called Transductive Transfer Learning commonly known as Domain Adaptation. If the source and target share the same do- main with different tasks this is Inductive Transfer Learning which learns to transfer via inductive bias. If the source and target have different  domains  and  different  tasks  this  is  a  form  of  unsuper- vised Transfer Learning which learns common representations de- spite having no direct similarities between the source and the tar- get. With this TL taxonomy we formulate a related breakdown for MTL.  While  MTL  terminology  is  traditionally  focused  on  varying tasks  it  is  also  possible  to  train  jointly  on  different  domains.  If the source task and auxiliary tasks are the same with different do- mains we label this Transductive Multi-Task Learning or Domain Regularization. When the source task and auxiliary tasks are dif- ferent  but  share  the  same  domain  this  is  the  standard  form  of MTL which we formally identify as Inductive Bias MTL. Finally if the source and auxiliary tasks are different and do not share the same domain we call it Multi-Task Feature Learning originally in- troduced by Romera-Paredes et al.  . Table  shows this break- down for both TL and MTL. A  relational  representation  of  these  concepts  is  provided  in Fig.  . This shows that TL and MTL share some overlap indicat- ing that these techniques can be used together. While Standley et al.    show  that  there  are  signicant  differences  in  the  types of  tasks  proven  to  be  useful  in  MTL  vs.  TL  Bingel  and  Sgaard   argue that they produce similar  observed benets.  Liu et al.   show  that  TL  and  MTL  are  complementary  to  one  another when  used  in  combination  to  train  a  complex  model  which  is in contradiction to earlier work that showed in different circum- stances this combination yielded no signicant improvement  . These techniques also overlap with standard single-task learning through a method called zero-shot learning. Zero-shot learners or generalist agents are capable of jointly understanding many tasks or concepts with no ne-tuning on specic tasks  . . When to use multi-task learning One of the biggest needs for a successful machine learning sys- tem is access to extremely large amounts of labeled data. MTL is proposed as a technique to help overcome data sparsity by learn- ing to jointly solve related or similar problems to produce a more generalized  internal  representation.  Regardless  of  the  number  of target tasks to solve MTL can only be considered useful when at least one target task is improved upon when compared to a collec- tion of single-task models  . Along with enabling zero-shot learning   MTL is commonly presented as a regularization technique to aid in the generaliza- tion of a task to unseen examples  . This belongs to the Transductive MTL class in Table  . Additionally  MTL  has  desirable  traits  when  it  comes  to  e- ciency.  Stickland  and  Murray    describe  a  well  designed  MTL model to be computationally less complex to have fewer parame- ters limiting the burden on memory and storage and to ultimately \\x0c J. Worsham and J. Kalita  Pattern Recognition Letters    Fig. .  Relationships of transfer learning and multi-task learning techniques for deep learning. require less power consumption at inference time. Standley et al.  also point out the desirable trait of quicker inferencing de- pending on the architecture of the MTL model. These characteris- tics pertain to neural network MTL implementations which are less expensive than deploying a complete model for each class individ- ually. . MTL implications and discoveries Researchers have been studying the implications and nuances of  MTL  when  compared  to  traditional  single-task  training  since its introduction. Given the human intuition of how MTL can help improve  model  performance  practitioners  are  often  surprised  at how delicate and sensitive these algorithms can be  . This sec- tion will discuss MTL discoveries in this regard through the topics of task relationship dataset diversity model design considerations and training curriculum. Techniques identied in this section are shown relationally in Fig.  . .. Task selection The similarities between a set of tasks are commonly cited as one of the most inuential design factors in building MTL systems. Through a series of experiments Caruana  showed that the ben- et of MTL is due to the direct knowledge learned from the aux- iliary tasks. He further showed that some inductive bias can actu- ally harm performance. A host of other researchers have gone on to argue that task relatedness plays a key role in determining how knowledge information is shared  and when an auxiliary task will help and when it will hurt  . Standley  et  al.    continued  to  explore  this  concept  and showed that tasks which seem related can often have underlying complex and competing dynamics. They present a table showing how every factorized task pair performed in relation to a single- task model and via the hypothesis that related tasks improve per- formance show which tasks they believe to be related. While this work was not performed on a set of NLP tasks it showed the im- portance of task relationship and provided a novel way to measure relatedness. intentionally to help regularize a system or even protect a system from adversarial attack. While this observation seems to disagree with the conventional wisdom that only similar or related tasks can lead to improved model performance   they are not alone. Romera- Paredes et al.  have also shown that unrelated tasks can still be benecial. This poses a unique opportunity to further explore task relationships and usefulness on the most recent MTL benchmarks. .. MTL dataset considerations The datasets used for target tasks and auxiliary tasks play an important role in building successful MTL systems. The rst topic addressed considers how the size and diversity of the datasets im- pact the learning of a model. Luong et al.  perform a set of experiments to determine how the size of the datasets for the tar- get and auxiliary tasks impact the overall results of the model on the target set. They show that the size ratio between a target task dataset and an auxiliary task dataset does have an impact on per- formance.  They  argue  that  when  the  target  dataset  is  large  the best MTL performance is achieved with a small auxiliary dataset with  a  size  ratio  between  .  and  ..  When  this  mixing  ratio gets too high it is shown that the model will overt to the aux- iliary task at the cost of performance on the target task. Other re- searchers agree that the best performance is achieved with a small number of auxiliary task updates compared to target task updates  and that adding more data to a poorly selected auxiliary task can signicantly harm the model  . Researchers have also considered the underlying properties and statistics to determine how they impact MTL performance. A theo- retical denition of MTL and task relatedness is presented by Ben- David and Borbely  . The goal of this work is to develop a formu- lated approach for determining when MTL is advantageous and to what degree. They seek a theoretical justication for task related- ness based on measurable similarities found within the underlying data generating processes of each task. While their denition of task more closely relates to the denition of a domain within this survey they establish formal error bounds to measure and learn task relatedness. Another  unique  observation  published  by  Standley  et  al.  shows that tasks which are benecial in a TL environment ap- pear to perform poorly as auxiliary tasks in an MTL setting. This raises a question on whether or not dissimilar tasks could be used Recent work has gone on to argue that size is not a useful met- ric for determining MTL gain  . Research has shown that simple tasks requiring few training iterations and dicult tasks which struggle to converge on a solution do not lead to the development \\x0cJ. Worsham and J. Kalita  Pattern Recognition Letters     of useful MTL representations  . Alonso and Plank  argue that MTL task selection should be addressed via data properties not intuition on what a human performer may consider easy. They perform  a  set  of  studies  that  measure  statistical  distributions  of supervised labels in auxiliary task datasets and nd that the best performance  is  achieved  when  the  auxiliary  tasks  have  compact mid-entropy distributions. That is to say the best auxiliary tasks are neither too easy to predict nor too dicult to learn. Another perspective on underlying properties of the auxiliary datasets is to consider the loss produced by each task while learn- ing. The magnitude of the task loss can be considered a task sim- ilarity metric. Standley et al.  show that imbalanced tasks in this  regard  produce  largely  varied  gradients  which  can  confuse model  training.  Oftentimes  task  selection  is  not  something  that can be changed but Standley et al.  recommend using a task weighting  coecient  to  help  normalize  the  gradient  magnitudes across the tasks. Similar to task loss the learning curve showing how loss decreases over training is also proposed as a metric for task similarity. It was found that MTL gains are more likely when a target tasks learning curve plateaus early in training and the aux- iliary tasks do not plateau  . It  is  also  worth  noting  that  Data  Augmentation  is  a  proven technique to help overcome data sparsity and improve task per- formance in TL and MTL settings. Anaby-Tavor et al.  propose LAMBADA a language generator model ne-tuned on a small task- specic dataset which generates semi-supervised training data to augment the data available to a task specic language classication task. .. Model selection and design There is a large body of research considering how MTL inu- ences model selection and design. While the authors acknowledge the importance of other machine learning models this section will focus solely on neural networks due to recent deep learning trends. Fig.  shows the primary MTL techniques for Deep Learning and their  relationships.  There  are  two  primary  families  of  MTL  neu- ral network approaches hard parameter sharing and soft param- eter  sharing   .  Hard  parameter  sharing  is  the  approach  most closely related to traditional machine learning techniques and the same mechanism used by many transfer learning solutions. In hard parameter  sharing  full  network  layers  and  their  parameters  are shared directly between tasks. Soft parameter sharing is more spe- cialized  and  instead  creates  separate  layer  parameters  for  each task. These task-specic layers are then regularized during train- ing to reduce the differences between shared layers. This encour- ages layers to have similar weights but allows each task to spe- cialize specic components. Diagrams showing these network con- cepts can be found in the MTL survey by Ruder  . Knowledge Distillation KD is a proven soft parameter technique which trains a student network to imitate the full output of a trained teacher network  . An early study in MTL showed that auxiliary tasks which help increase performance on a target task prefer to share hidden layers and weights with the target task while unhelpful auxiliary tasks prefer to use weights not used by the target task  . This intu- ition has laid the groundwork for deep learning models which fo- cus on building an enhanced internal representation of a problem space through shared hidden layers. It has been shown that pre- dening which layers to share can improve the performance of a deep learning MTL model when the tasks are generally benecial but this can break down if the wrong task pairs are selected  . The study goes on to argue for the benet of learning task hierar- chies internal to the model during training to help overcome this problem. Research has also shown that the depth of a layer and the benet of sharing the layer between two tasks can be consid- ered a measure of similarity of the two tasks  . They argue that low-level layers such as word embeddings are generally useful for all NLP tasks while higher level layers become more specic and can only be shared among more similar tasks. This suggests that model architectures can be built off this metric when combined with other evaluations of task relatedness. Another model consideration when building MTL systems is the capacity of the network. Radford et al.  prove that the capac- ity of a language model is essential to good performance and that increasing  capacity  produces  a  log-linear  improvement.  This  fol- lows conventional neural network wisdom and agrees with other research such as BERT   whose performance appears to scale with the model size and T   which achieved state-of-the-art results when pushed to  billion parameters. Ruder  et  al.    show  that  hard-parameter  sharing  task- specic network layers hierarchical NLP layers and a regularizer to encourage tasks to share only what is useful called block-sparse regularization can be combined to create a powerful MTL network called a Sluice network. The Sluice network consistently performed better than single-task multi-layer perceptrons MLPs on all eval- uation tasks and outperformed traditional hard parameter sharing approaches  on most NLP tasks. An additional question that must be addressed is how a task is represented within the model. It is common with Inductive Bias MTL  that  each  task  has  a  specic  set  of  output  layers  that  can be queried to return task specic results  . However McCann et  al.    present  a  novel  idea  in  which  the  task  itself  in  in- cluded  as  input  to  the  network  identied  within  this  survey  as Context Tasking. While the implementation may differ across do- mains and tasks Context Tasking was implemented here by rep- resenting each task as a natural language question with a natu- ral language answer. This avoids the need for any task-specialized components and naturally supports zero-shot learning and open- set classication  . Aralikatte et al.  present another interest- ing approach to Context Tasking by casting the NLP tasks of ellip- sis resolution and coreference resolution as reading comprehension problems and produced new state-of-the-art results using Induc- tive Bias MTL. .. Training curriculum A  nal  topic  of  MTL  training  implications  is  the  design  of  a training curriculum. Given the research above regarding mixing ra- tios task weighting shared representations and sensitivities to task selection it seems natural that MTL should be addressed with an intelligent  training  curriculum.  The  standard  curriculum  for  MTL tasks  is  to  build  mini-batches  containing  examples  for  a  single task  and  then  alternate  between  tasks  during  training.  The  ra- tio  of  task  mini-batches  can  be  identical  for  all  tasks  or  varied based on task performance or dataset size  . McCann et al.  refer to this as a xed-order round robin curriculum and prove that it works well on tasks that require few iterations but it struggles with more complex tasks. They furthermore consider hand-crafted curricula and show that beginning with more dicult tasks  and  slowly  introducing  additional  tasks  performs  the  best. Other work has considered including task-specic stopping condi- tions for TL and MTL   and more recent research has proposed a teacher-based annealing solution to dynamically control the aux- iliary  task  impact  with  KD   .  Other  research  has  shown  that round robin training is most impactful towards the end of the cur- riculum  . They propose a technique called annealed sampling in which batch sampling is originally based on the ratio of dataset sizes and slowly anneals to an even distribution across all tasks as the current  epoch number increases. These discoveries when combined with curriculum research emerging from the eld of re- \\x0c J. Worsham and J. Kalita  Pattern Recognition Letters    inforcement learning   lead to a wealth of new research oppor- tunities towards the design of MTL curricula. . Learning task relationships Beyond  the  research  into  measuring  properties  of  tasks  and datasets to determine similarities there have been multiple effort s to intrinsically learn task relatedness through a learning process. Caruana  showed that neural networks trained in an MTL set- ting exhibited a behavior where related tasks would share hidden nodes and unrelated tasks would not. This discovery implies that neural networks are able to determine what information is use- ful for sharing between tasks without an explicit signal conveying the task relationship. It is therefore reasonable to believe that neu- ral networks are able to learn and even describe task relationship explicitly through the MTL training process. Research has since ex- plored different clustering techniques built on this discovery which attempt to cluster network weights and parameters leading to a latent  task  relationship  embedded  in  the  task  clusters   .  Not only do these techniques inherently learn task relationships they also help to train neural networks by penalizing them from diverg- ing too much from a common set of knowledge shared by similar tasks. Ruder  also presents the Deep Relationship Network and the Cross-Stitch Network which are hard and soft parameter mod- els respectively able to identify task relationship through training. An approach called taskvec has been proposed which learns an embedding vector for an entire task that is agnostic to the size of the dataset  . The embedding attempts to capture semantic similarities between tasks by training a model to solve a task and then probing the network to approximate the amount of informa- tion carried by the weights. The proximities between two task em- bedding vectors are theorized to represent task relatedness while the magnitude of the embedding vector is thought to correlate to the complexity of the task. An  alternative  approach  to  learning  directly  from  the  hidden nodes and gradients is to eciently search through task pairs to determine  task  similarities.  Depending  on  the  number  of  tasks an  exhaustive  search  very  quickly  becomes  impossible  however heuristic based searches have been found to act as a good stand- in  to  estimate  when  tasks  may  be  related   .  They  show  that there is a high correlation between the validation loss of a network trained on  of the data and the fully trained validation loss of a network. Based on this claim they use the loss at  as a heuris- tic  to  lightly  train  multi-task  permutations  for  nding  optimally performing task sets. They go on to show that given three tasks the average loss of every two-pair combination is an effective ap- proximation  of  the  loss  when  all  three  tasks  are  trained  jointly. This acts as a good search heuristic for nding optimized task sets. While this work has focused on small task sets and relatively small combinations others have shown the benet of having many auxil- iary tasks to boost MTL performance  . More research into the  implications of  these  ndings  is  important to  understanding the effect of the number of tasks present in an auxiliary task set. . MTL benchmarks and leaderboards While there are many research efforts that evaluate MTL model performance  on  custom  task  sets  there  exist  several  gold  stan- dard benchmarks which enable comparative evaluation. The rst of  these  is  the  NLP  Decathlon     decaNLP  which  combines ten  common  NLP  tasksdatasets  Question  Answering  Machine Translation Summarization Natural Language Inference Sentiment Analysis  Semantic  Role  Labeling  Zero-Shot  Relation  Extraction Goal-Oriented  Dialog  Semantic  Parsing  and  Pronoun  Resolution. Each task is assigned a scoring metric between  and . An over- all decaScore is computed as the sum of all the task scores with the highest possible being   . Using the Context Tasking tech- nique every task is represented as a natural language question a context and an answer. The decaNLP leaderboard presents an op- portunity for MTL researchers to assess model performance. One  of  the  most  popular  evaluation  benchmarks  used  for  TL and MTL alike is the General Language Understanding Evaluation GLUE   .  GLUE  challenges  models  to  solve  the  following   NLP  tasks  Grammatical  Acceptance Prediction  Sentiment Analy- sis Paraphrasing Semantic Equivalence Semantic Similarity Ques- tion Answering Pronoun Resolution and two different Textual En- tailment tasks. Each task has a dened scoring metric to evaluate task-specic performance F score is commonly used among the tasks. GLUE does not require that all tasks be solved by the same model and as such many top solutions have a ne-tuned model per task. An overall GLUE score the macro-average of all tasks is computed for each model. In order to keep challenging researchers to push the state-of- the-art  an  additional  NLP  benchmark  called  SuperGLUE  is  pre- sented which is designed to be signicantly more dicult  . The following  tasks are included in the SuperGLUE Binary Question Answering Imbalanced -Class Textual Entailment Logical Causal Relationship Textual Entailment Binary Word-Sense Disambigua- tion Pronoun Resolution and two different Multiple-Choice Ques- tion Answering tasks. Textual Entailment and Pronoun Resolution are the only two tasks from the original GLUE benchmark retained in  SuperGLUE.  These  tasks  were  kept  because  they  still  showed room for improvement and proved to be two of the hardest tasks in GLUE. . MTL solutions for NLP There is a rich library of research presenting technical imple- mentations and use cases for MTL models and architectures. This section provides an overview of recent state-of-the-art approaches. Table  shows a comparison of model sizes and scores on common benchmarks. .. Multi-task question answering network The Multi-task Question Answering Network MQAN  is a natural language Context Tasking network designed to jointly learn over all tasks with no task specic weights or parameters in the network.  All  inputs  and  tasks  are  modeled  as  natural  language questions and outputs in the form of a natural language answer. This enables the network to learn to solve tasks which tradition- ally have different input and output structures such as machine translation and relation extraction. The authors show that MQAN is able to achieve performance comparable to ten single-task net- works with no ne-tuning or task specic layers. Due to the com- mon  contextualized  input  design  MQAN  is  able  to  do  zero-shot training and can even adapt to unseen classes in classication. Table  MTL model comparison.

Worsham and J. Kalita  Pattern Recognition Letters     .. BERT and related models .. T Arguably one of the most important models recently proposed is BERT Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers  . BERT pre-trains a transformer model  with an unsuper- vised  multi-task  objective.  This  pre-training  objective  trains  the network to predict a random mask of hidden words in a text doc- ument and to predict if a shown sentence is the logical next sen- tence in the document via a binary classier. Along with the novel pre-training  objective  BERT  also  presents  a  mechanism  for  con- textualizing on both the left and right text directions while other popular models such as GPT   are unidirectional. BERT scored competitively on the GLUE leaderboard and provided a base for re- searchers to build upon. Since  the  release  of  BERT  there  have  been  a  number  of modications  which  have  surpassed  the  baseline  score  on  GLUE  . BERT and PALs train a single BERT model to be used for all tasks jointly as opposed to building a ne-tuned model for each task  . Clark et al.  approach MTL with BERT from a differ- ent angle by doing multi-task ne-tuning through knowledge dis- tillation and a multi-teacher paradigm called BAM. The model is trained with a teacher annealing curriculum that gradually trans- fers the target learner from distillation through the teachers to a supervised MTL signal. RoBERTa is an optimized take on BERT that nds techniques which signicantly improve performance  . AL- BERT replaces the next sentence prediction task proven ineffective by Yang et al.   with a sentence-order prediction pre-training task  . One  notable  extension  of  BERT  with  true  multi-task  learning across  all    GLUE  tasks  is  the  Multi-Task  Deep  Neural  Network MT-DNN  . The authors argue that MT-DNN has better domain transfer across tasks than standard BERT. The process begins with the regular BERT pre-training followed by multi-task training with hard parameter sharing and a random round robin curriculum and nally ends with task-specic ne-tuning. .. GPTGPT- BERT  is  not  the  only  type  of  language  model  that  has  suc- cessfully  performed  in  MTL  environments.  GPT    is  based  on a  multi-layer  transformer  network  and  GPT-    extends  this model with an unsupervised multi-task pre-training objective. In inference settings GPT- is rst task-conditioned to solve the de- sired  task.  This  zero-shot  type  of  learning  can  outperform  the current state-of-the-art on a majority of NLP tasks. GPT- is also shown to perform competitively when used in a traditional pre- training and ne-tuning process. The authors have indicated that in future work they plan to assess GPT- performance on decaNLP and GLUE benchmarks. .. XLNet XLNet  is  proposed  as  a  next-generation  model  which  is  in- tended to leverage the best features found in BERT and GPT while overcoming  their  intrinsic  shortcomings   .  The  authors  claim that  BERT  suffers  from  a  pre-trainne-tune  discrepancy  due  to the masked words introduced in pre-training. While the masked words are helpful for building a latent understanding of language masked words are never seen in practice and thus there is a dis- tinct difference in the training data and real-world inputs. While this simplication has worked well for BERT Yang et al.  at- tempt to improve performance by estimating the joint probability of the words seen in a piece of text. The authors also empirically show that BERTs next sentence prediction pre-training objective did not improve model performance and hence was dropped from the XLNet pre-training regimen. T  Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer is a renement to the  traditional  transformer  which  boasts  an  unsupervised  pre- training corpus of roughly  GB and uses natural language Con- text Tasking. The highest performing model designed by the au- thors contains  billion parameters far more than what any other model has considered and has beaten all other models addressed above on the GLUE and SuperGLUE leaderboards. This work pro- vides convincing evidence regarding the claim that model capacity is an important factor in transfer learning and MTL in NLP. . Current challenges and opportunities Most challenges that are still faced today in MTL are the same challenges  that  have  existed  for  the  past  two  decades.  Caruana  proved that some inductive bias can hurt and while it is still generally believed that task relatedness leads to good bias there is no strong general notion of measuring this  . Standley et al.  begin to address this by confronting the underlying chal- lenge of crosstalk in which MTL suffers from complex and com- peting objectives. Additional studies have researched task relation- ship  and  performance  on  earlier  model  generations  such  as  bi- LSTMs   .  Studies  applying  similar  in-depth  analysis  to  the most  recent  multi-task  benchmarks  with  the  latest  transformer- based models are prime research opportunities to understand bet- ter the tasks to solve and the implications of the selected models. Standley et al.  present several interesting claims which are worth exploring and applying to known MTL benchmarks. The rst is that it could be better to train dissimilar tasks as opposed to se- mantically similar tasks. Additionally they argue that MTL perfor- mance estimates can be made by averaging the results of lesser- order task pairs. Both claims present research opportunities that could lead to better understanding of the impact of auxiliary task selection. The new set of MTL deep learning models should also be explored through probing in a manner similar to that of Kim et al.  to understand better the impact of NLP task selection. There still is a need for deeper and more general techniques for task selection and task assessment. As research dives deeper into the implications of MTL it is important to continue strengthening the current understanding of task relationship and selection. Curriculum learning is continuing to gain popularity and will likely become of larger interest with the introduction of standard- ized MTL benchmarks. Curriculum learning has not been explored much in NLP or MTL however it has a rich history in reinforce- ment  learning  RL  where  curriculum  is  used  to  guide  trained agents to more complex and realistic behaviors  . The cur- riculum is often generated in RL settings and it would be interest- ing to expand on these capabilities for MTL curriculum generation. These generations could leverage some form of relatedness  or be  driven  by  unsupervised  or  latent  signals   .  Other  research into lifelong learning and continuous learning  present new ideas and paradigms which are related to MTL and can be utilized to help solve the MTL tasks mentioned in this survey. Although  many  unsupervised  natural  language  understanding tasks have recently been used in a pre-training setting Luong et al.  pose the question of how unsupervised objectives may im- pact MTL performance as auxiliary tasks. Building off the TL pro- cess there are open questions on how an MTL model can lever- age the same unsupervised datasets. They argue that an auxiliary task  must  be  compatible  with  the  target  task  and  both  intrin- sic perplexity and extrinsic accuracy metrics must be improved on  the  target  task  when  trained  with  the  auxiliary  task.  Alonso and  Plank    pose  an  additional  question  most  auxiliary  tasks are classication tasks how do regression tasks fare as auxiliary tasks Gonzlez-Garduno and Sgaard  provide an example of \\x0c J. Worsham and J. Kalita  Pattern Recognition Letters    this with text readability prediction and an auxiliary gaze predic- tion task. They showed that they only needed small samples from the auxiliary task the selection of the auxiliary task was robust to small changes in the domain and the shared feature representation provably enhanced model performance. This work shows that fur- ther research into regression auxiliary tasks could help to advance MTL state-of-the-art. Finally Liu et al.  present a unique oppor- tunity to study how MTL architectures perform against adversarial tasks which could potentially lead to a new set of hardened aux- iliary tasks. We hypothesize that Domain Regularization or Multi- Task Feature Learning could help machine learning models better withstand adversarial attacks. Most recent advancements in TL and MTL are based off hard parameter sharing. How do model architectures such as the trans- former perform when regularized with an MTL-based soft param- eter sharing How would this compare to standard models such as BERT and GPT and what other techniques can be borrowed from Ruder  for the latest generation of deep learning models Lastly the biggest challenge faced in current MTL research is that  ne-tuned  single-task  models  consistently  outperform  non- ne-tuned MTL models that share layers  . MTL pre-training followed  by  single-task  ne-tuning  is  able  to  leverage  the  rich knowledge acquired through inductive bias but the impact of the strong  supervised  signal  creates  narrow  experts  which  are  able to  outperform  the  generalized  experts  produced  by  MTL.  While this is ne for narrow systems designed to solve problems with expansive  training  datasets  this  gap  needs  to  be  closed  to  im- prove  performance  on  data  sparse  tasks  and  domains.  A  long- term  goal  that  will  continue  to  persist  is  to  develop  general experts  which  can  compete  with  their  single-task  counterparts  . Ultimately we nd this ambitious task before us. To nd ways to build robust and capable MTL models and help to enable the next generation of general Articial Intelligence.

Classifying test cases into two main classes  dependent and independent  can be employedfor several test optimization purposes such as parallel test execution test automation test case selection andprioritization and test suite reduction. This task can be seen as an imbalanced classification problem due tothe test cases distribution. Often the number of dependent and independent test cases is uneven which isrelated to the testing level testing environment and complexity of the system under test. In this study wepropose a novel methodology that consists of two main steps. Firstly by using natural language processing weanalyze the test cases specifications and turn them into a numeric vector. Secondly by using the obtained datavectors we classify each test case into a dependent or an independent class. We carry out a supervised learningapproach using different methods for handling imbalanced datasets. The feasibility and possible generalizationof the proposed methodology is evaluated in two industrial projects at Bombardier Transportation Swedenwhich indicates promising results.. IntroductionSoftware testing is an important and effort-intensive activity in thesoftware development life cycle SDLC and thus test optimizationplays a vital role in the testing domain. According to reports fromboth academia and industry the process of software testing can takeof up to  of the total development cost Algroth et al. .The testing cost can be decreased by using test automation test caseselection and prioritization and test suite minimization Nardo et al.. The research results indicate that the application of an artificialintelligence AI technique has real potential for making a positiveimpact on software testing. Moreover the increase in availability of AItechnologies provides opportunities to improve the existing softwaretesting processes Chen et al. .Nowadays the process of testing can be performed manually semi-or fully automated. In a manual testing procedure a set of test spec-ifications needs to be created for every system under test SUT. Themanual testing process is still a popular approach especially in thesafety critical systems where assurance arguments ultimately dependon human judgment Chechik et al. . Since both manual testcreation and manual test execution are time and resource consumingprocesses it can be beneficial to apply AI technologies such as machinelearning and deep learning for analyzing test cases.Reports from different industries show that the dependencies be-tween the integration of test cases have a direct impact on the testexecution results where the dependent test cases can fail after eachother if they are ranked in the wrong order Parsa et al.  Arltet al. . Nonetheless classifying test cases into dependent andindependent classes is a challenging task because of the followingreasons. It requires capturing and analyzing various testing artifacts suchas requirement specifications test records system architecturesignal information among others.

The problem suffers from imbalanced class distribution which isstill a challenging problem in data mining Lopez et al. .Since the main goal of the dependency detection between test casesis test efficiency and cost minimization the new approaches shouldbe accurate applicable in different contexts and should not requireextra efforts. Employing AI techniques on manual test cases can provideuseful input which can be utilized for test optimization purposes.In this study we aim to split manual integration test cases into twomain classes dependent and independent. To tackle our problem wepropose a two-step methodology.I The first step is to obtain a numeric dataset format. In thisregard we use neural networks model that turns the manualdescriptions of the test cases into numeric vectors of descriptivefeatures. Afterwards each of the test cases is assigned to a deci-sion attribute dependent or independent. As stated earlierin many cases the number of dependent and independent testcases is unevenly distributed which means that we are facing aclass imbalance problem.II The second step is to carry out a supervised learning classifica-tion for imbalanced datasets. The imbalance classification hasbecome a top issue within the machine learning community.There are many examples of real-world applications that study thisproblem such as medical applications Mazurowskia et al.  Gaoet al.  image recognition Kubat et al.  Buda et al. risk management Huang et al.  or anomaly detection Khreichet al. . Indeed a different variety of solutions for class imbalanceproblems have been proposed in recent years. They can be divided intofour main groups data level design of specific classification algorithmscost sensible and ensembles. Although the wide range of solutionscurrently available are state of the art finding the most appropriate so-lution for a specific problem can lead to a fairly extensive experimentalstudy. For our study we select a set of well-known methods from thefour-groups mentioned above.The proposed methodology is evaluated on industrial case-studiesat Bombardier transportation BT in Sweden. Two on-going testingprojects  projects  and   are selected where all designed infor-mation for these two projects is extracted from BTs database. Bothprojects are designed for testing trains where a separate team is behindeach. Although they both test a train product the test cases which aredesigned for testing project  should not be utilized for project .The organization of the paper is laid out as follows Section  pro-vides a background of the initial problem. The dependency detectionin the software testing domain and an overview of the usage of AItechnologies in this area are presented in Section . Section  describesthe structure of the proposed methodology. Two industrial case studiesare shown in Section . The obtained results are depicted in Section .Finally Section  concludes the paper and clarifies some points offuture directions of this study.. PreliminariesThis section provides the preliminaries for the present study. Weexplain the need of separating dependent and independent test cases.Moreover some relevant theoretical elements are also described toachieve a better understanding of our proposal. Later in this section weprovide some background information about natural language process-ing NLP and the utilized method in this paper DocVec. Finally theclass imbalance problem and its most relevant solutions are presented.Fig. . Example of an embedded digraph of dependencies for five test cases... Dependency detectionDependency between integration test cases can be considered asa critical criterion for test optimization in any form of test selectionprioritization scheduling Yoo and Harman  Elbaum et al. Tahvili et al. a and test automation. There are several kindsof dependencies between test cases e.g. abstract dependency causaldependency or temporal dependency. In our previous work Tahviliet al.  we defined a new type of dependency called functionaldependency which usually occurs between integration test cases andhas a direct effect on the test execution results. Given that test case  is functionally dependent on test case   if   fails duringthe testing process   will fail as well. This kind of dependencyhas been observed in several cases in different domains Arlt et al. Tahvili et al. b. Therefore detecting the dependenciesbetween test cases is important since it can be utilized later for rankingthem for execution based on their relationship with other test cases.Usually in this approach test cases are connected and following eachother in succession as a directed graph chain. Thus independenttest cases e.g.   in Fig.  should be executed first and then allother dependent test cases. To clarify the explanation let us considera dummy example with five test cases TC TC TC TC and TC.Let us assume that we can describe the following embedded directedgraph of dependenciesAs we can see in Fig.      and   are independent testcases   depends on  .   directly depends on     and  where we call them as the precedents and indirectly dependson  . The presented test cases in Fig.  can be executed in adifferent order such as first all independent test cases     and  are ranked first for execution or   and   are scheduledfor execution first and later two independent test cases   and  .Detecting this grid of dependencies is required to analyze several layersof the testing process such as requirement specifications and softwaremodules. However the mentioned required information is not availablein all testing projects and sometimes the process of capturing themtakes more time than any random test execution. On the other handknowing the dependency between test cases can be utilized for othertest optimization purposes such as parallel test execution and testautomation where independent test cases can be considered as goodcandidates for automation in a semi-automated testing procedure.For clustering and classifying test cases based on their dependencieswe can employ just their test specifications. Previously Tahvili et al. we divided test cases from one industrial project into severalclusters based on their dependencies. However in the current studywe are aiming to classify all test cases into two groups dependentand independent as mirrored in Fig. . The main reasons behind this It is dummy in the sense that the number of test cases is very smallcompared with real industry cases.\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   Fig. . Classifying test cases into two main classes dependent and independent.approach can be summarized as  - improving the obtained resultsfrom the clustering approach in Tahvili et al.  - employing theground truth for labeling data and thereby applying a supervised learn-ing approach and - applying a different methodology for classifyingtest cases into dependent and independent... On the use of natural language processingTable  shows an example of a manual test case for a safetycritical system which consists of test case ID test case descriptionexpected test result test steps corresponding requirements etc. In thisexample two requirements SRS-BHH-LineVolt and SRS-BHH-Speed are assigned to the test case.As mentioned in Section  in a manual testing procedure all testingartifacts e.g. requirements and test cases are written by testers. There-fore employing natural language processing techniques might providehighly useful information which can be utilized for test optimizationpurposes.Examples include automatic test creation from the textual require-ments and automatic testing oracle generation for unusual behaviorsfrom Javadoc comments Goffi et al.  as well as automatic testgeneration from bug reports Fazzini et al. . Heretofore someNLP techniques are employed by us for extracting test case executiontime Tahvili et al. a scheduling test cases for execution based ontheir semantic similarity Tahvili et al. c detecting the functionaldependency between test cases through analyzing requirement specifi-cations Tahvili et al. b and also test case specifications Tahviliet al. . However not all required test artifacts for dependencydetection are accessible in all testing processes at industries. A deep un-derstanding of test specifications can help us to detect the dependenciesbetween test cases in a more promising way.... Neural networks in natural language processingAlthough employing classical machine learning approaches e.g.Naive Bayes Support Vector Machine received a great deal of at-tention for text analysis neural networks models are shown to per-form better for more complex tasks such as sentiment analysis andtranslation Majumder et al. .Neural embedding models usually refer to methods for embed-ding words or documents into a vector space via utilizing neuralnetworks Maslova and Potapov . The neural networks takeover adjacent word embeddings where the information contained inadjacent words is learned effectively. Therefore they show better per-formance compared to other text analysis methods on classificationFig. . The structure of the PV-DBOW model.tasks e.g. sentiment analysis spam detection and also topic catego-rization Zhang et al. . WordVec DocVec and FastText Joulinet al.  can be mentioned as some examples of the neural networksmodels for word and document embedding.DocVec was first proposed by Le and Mikolov  in . Ithas excellent scalability and has filled in gaps of previous approacheswhere the semantics of the words were ignored. Another of its advan-tages is that it learns from unlabeled data meaning that it is applicablefor tasks that do not have enough labeled data which is often thecase in industrial applications. The approach is also independent ofthe language and it can be applied to most languages with minimalmodification. The goal of the algorithm is to create a fixed-length nu-meric representation of a document regardless of its length. Indeed foreach document DocVec provides an -dimensional vector in whicheach dimension can be interpreted as a feature. DocVec representsa document with a non-fixed length into a vector and concatenateseach word of that document. There are several variants of the DocVecmethod. In this paper we use paragraph vectors with a distributed bagof words model PV-DBOW which uses a single layer neural networksto predict whether a word is contained in a given document.Fig.  shows the basic idea behind the PV-DBOW model. We needto consider that the PV-DBOW model ignores the context words inthe input but it forces the model to predict words randomly sampledfrom the paragraph in the output and a Paragraph ID Witt and Seifert. Moreover the Paragraph Matrix in Fig.  is the matrix whereeach column represents the vector of a paragraph. Matrix  has theembeddings for seen paragraphs for words. For unseen paragraphsthe model is again ran by gradient descent to derive a documentvector Le and Mikolov  Witt and Seifert . For instancegiven a sentence including three words W W W see Fig. two words are sampled from it.After training these neural networks we can extract the trainedvalues to form feature vectors. These vectors are intended to representthe concepts of the documents. Each element of the vector creates anabstraction for several terms from the corpus. Given a large enoughcorpus the distance between the vectors corresponding to semanticallysimilar documents is lower than the ones that are not. DocVec is basedaround learning vector representations of words using neural networks.It is trained using stochastic gradient descendent where the gradientis obtained via back-propagation. Therefore each time we apply thealgorithm to a group of documents we get a different set of vectors.Nevertheless the relative distance of semantically related documents isstatistically indistinguishable from run to run Rekabsaz et al. .This means that for each run it is expected that the vectors from thetwo different classes keep a higher distance while the vectors fromthe same class have a lower distance which is the key point for theclassification step. Taking this into account in order to keep the vectorscomparable we run DocVec at the same time for both training andtesting documents. Previously Tahvili et al.  we showed the\\x0cS. Tahvili L.

On the use of imbalance learningAs emphasized earlier the dependency problem suffers from animbalanced dataset. The class imbalance problem appears when oneconcept the minority class to be classified is significantly less repre-sented than the other the majority class. The imbalanced ratio IR isa well-known measure in the imbalanced domain. It is a ratio betweenthe number of samples in the majority class and the number of samplesin the minority class see Eq. . .Some researchers consider that a dataset suffers from an imbalancedproblem if the IR is higher than . We can compute the IR using Eq. .To find a more appropriate solution for imbalanced proportionof classes we use imbalanced learning which has recently becomea top research topic in the machine learning community Fernndezet al. . The classification task can become very complicated whenconcepts are not equally represented in the data sample Batista et al. Bi and Zhang  Galar et al.  Jensen and Cornelis Khan et al.  Ramentol et al. .The main problem with imbalanced data is that traditional classi-fiers do not take into account class distribution. Instead they operatewith global metrics and as a consequence the less represented classknown as minority or positive tends to be poorly classified while themajority or negative tends to be very well classified. However theconcept of greatest interest is usually in the minority class.This phenomenon has attracted a lot of attention resulting in a set ofgood solutions. These solutions can be divided into four main groupsI. Data level solutions Ramentol et al.  Batista et al. Han et al.  Chawla et al.  This group of solutionsconsists of modifying the data distribution via removing ex-amples from the majority class known as undersampling orby creating examples from the minority class known as over-sampling. Moreover any combinations of undersampling andoversampling is known as hybrid solutions.II. Cost sensitive solutions Ting  Zadrozny et al. Zhou and Liu  This group of solutions consists of the useof solutions at data level algorithm level or both at the sametime in order to minimize higher cost errors.III. Ensemble solutions Galar et al.   Ensemble so-lutions in imbalanced domains are mostly a combination of anensemble with one of the techniques above. The most commonensemble are the solutions which use a data level approach or acost sensitive solution.IV. Algorithm level solutions Cieslak et al.  Ramentol et al. This group of solutions consists of modifying the learningalgorithm in order to deal directly with the imbalance data.These solutions could be more versatile since it does not modifythe data distribution. For example modifying the cost per classor adjusting probability estimation in the leaves of the decisiontrees.In this work we compare the performance of ten proposed imbal-ance approaches in the state of the art. Next a short description ofeach of them is given.. SyntheticMinoritySMOTEOversamplingChawla et al.  This oversampling technique creates syn-thetic examples through performing an interpolation of oneminority example and its nearest neighbor.Technique\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   . Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Edited NearestNeighbor SMOTE-ENN Batista et al.  This hybrid so-lution first creates synthetic examples using SMOTE and thenremoves the examples which are misclassified by their threeclosest neighbors. ENN is also able to remove examples fromboth classes.. SMOTE-Borderline  Han et al.  This method presentsa modified version of the original SMOTE. Instead of creatingsynthetic examples SMOTE-Borderline  utilizes all the minor-ity examples and only oversamples those minorities which areconsidered as Borderline. The method classifies every minorityexample into three categories noise danger and safe attendingto the number of nearest neighbors in the majority class. Finallyin the SMOTE phase only the examples in danger will be usedfor generating new ones.. SMOTE-Borderline  Han et al.  This method is verysimilar to the SMOTE-Borderline  and they only differ fromeach other by the generating strategy for the synthetic exam-ples. SMOTE-Borderline  uses danger examples for generat-ing synthetic examples and minorities nearest neighbor. Thismethod also finds the nearest neighbor in both classes. Laterits nearest majority neighbor will be multiplied by a randomnumber between  and . and therefore the newly generatedexamples are closer to the minority class.. Safelevel Bunkhumpornpat et al.  This method defines asafe level for every minority example which creates syntheticexamples closer to them.. Spider Stefanowski and Wilk  This method removes ma-jority examples that can affect the correct classification of theminority examples. Later it creates synthetic examples usingthe minority examples which are overwhelmed by objectssurrounding the majority classes.. Cost SensitiveC. Ting  This method builds some deci-sion trees that try to minimize the number of high cost errorsand as a consequence leads to the minimization of the totalmisclassification costs in most cases.. SVM-Cost Sensitive Vapnik  This method biases tradi-tional Support Vector Machine classifier SVM in a way thatwill push the boundary away from the positive instances usingdifferent error costs for the positive and negative classes.. EUSBOOST Galar et al.  This algorithm belongs to theensemble group. It combines boosting with the use of Evo-lutionary Undersampling EUS where each chromosome hasa binary coding that represents the presence or non-presenceof the example in the dataset. The fitness function takes intoaccount the imbalance distribution favoring the minority class.. IFROWANN Ramentol et al.  This algorithm is a power-ful classifier specifically designed for imbalanced data. It is basedon the Fuzzy Rough Nearest Neighbor FRNN classifier Jensenand Cornelis . It computes the sum of the memberships ofeach example to the fuzzy-rough lower and upper approximationof each class which is then assigned to the class with thehigher sum. IFROWANN introduces the use of Ordered WeightedAverage OWA operators to determine the positive and negativeregions in order to consider the differences between the num-bers of examples in classes. The authors proposed the use of different weighting strategies combined with  alternatives fordefining the fuzzy Minimum Average and ukasiewicz.. Related workIn this section we discuss the related work from two dimensionsof interest beginning with some of the proposed solutions for solvingthe dependency problem in the software testing domain and thenpresenting a non-exhaustive overview of the use of NLP approaches insoftware testing... Dependency identification in software testingTo avoid unproductive testing of unaffected components in a mod-ified program Bates and Horwitz  identify components throughprogram dependence graphs and slicing with test adequacy data. Anew diagram type a dependency chart is introduced by Ryser andGlinz  to manage dependencies and interrelations between sce-narios of system testing. Haidry and Miller  use a directedgraph to identify functionally dependent test cases. An approach toautomatically detect redundant test cases based on logical dependencybetween structured requirements is given by Arlt et al. . Inour earlier work Tahvili et al.  we divided test cases intodependent and independent classes using semantic text similarity clus-tering and random undersampling. However random undersamplingcauses missing some data points where some important informationabout the decision boundary between the minority and majority classindependent test cases in Tahvili et al.  might be eliminated.On the other hand the application of text similarity techniques insoftware testing is already a growing research topic where researchershave applied it for test selection Unterkalmsteiner et al.  testprioritization Thomas et al. a and prioritization of test automa-tion Tahvili et al. ... Natural language processing in software testingChen et al.  wrote a survey paper on the use of topic modelsin software engineering. Topic models discover structure within anunstructured collection of written text through statistical properties ofword frequencies. Latent Semantic Indexing LSI and Latent DirichletAllocation LDA are two examples of topic models. A topic is acollection of words that co-occur frequently and are often semanticallyrelated. Organization of unstructured text into topics helps to indexsearching and clustering of information. In software testing Islam et al. used LSI to link test cases and software requirements. This wasemployed to prioritize test cases using a multi-objective optimizationapproach. Thomas et al. b applied LDA in test suites to givehigher priority to test cases that test different functionalities of thesoftware under test. Chen et al.  adopted LDA to find topicsin source code files and test cases. Based on topic defect density andhow well-tested a topic is less-tested and defect-prone topics are thensuggested as candidates for allocating more testing resources. Lin et al. proposed a NLP-based approach for improving the effectivenessof crawling-based web application testing. They applied three transfor-mations sequentially to feature vectors Bag-of-words tf-idf and LSI.The evaluation of their approach on input topic identification showedimproved accuracy. Preeti et al.  used NLP to extract combi-natorial test design model elements from use case specification usingAlchemy API and NLTK with Python scripts. They combined the resultswith combinatorial test design model elements extraction from use casediagrams using a rules-based approach. The parameters and valuesare then presented as a list of suggestions to the test designer. Nak-agawa and Tsuchiya  proposed a linguistic approach to extractconstraints from requirements document for combinatorial test design.They identify constraints based on the distance between the words inthe requirements document using a coupling metric. Zalmanovici et al. provide a clustering approach where a test suite is automaticallyclustered into disjoint clusters. These clusters can then be exploited indifferent ways treating each cluster as a functional part suggestingredundant tests in a cluster and creating input for combinatorial testingby extracting a model per cluster. Test clustering is achieved usingLevenshstein distance and DBScan is used as the clustering algorithm.Clustering of test cases has also been experimented by Yoo et al. using hamming distance Leon and Podgurski  using Euclideandistance Arafeen and Do  using tf-idf for requirements basedtesting.In this work we propose a novel methodology for analyzing thetest case specifications and then dividing test cases into dependent\\x0cS.

Themost important difference between exiting solutions and our proposedmethodology is the required input. Most of the proposed approachesrequire several testing artifacts e.g. requirement specifications andarchitecture of the software product. The proposed methodology in thiswork just needs the test case specifications which are always availablein all testing projects.Table The tokenized version of the presented test case in Table .no active cab lock and set auxiliary reservoir pressure . bar signalcommand auxiliary compressor activate cab a lock and set signal brakingmode from atp to  signal braking mode to idu is set to  lock and setauxiliary reservoir pressure . bar signal auxiliary compressor is runningto idu is set to false wait  s reset dynamic brake in the train for  sidu in b car as on set auxiliary reservoir pressure . bar signal auxiliarycompressor is running to idu is set to false clean up. The methodologyThis section provides a methodology for solving the initial problem.The main goal of this paper is to split manual integration test cases intodependent and independent classes. The proposed methodology in thisstudy can mainly be divided into two main stepsI. Text analysis Since the manual test cases are written in textemploying NLP technologies for latent semantic analysis canprovide some clues for dependency detection. In this step alldesigned test cases need to be parsed and converted to anotherformat e.g. vectors for further syntactic analysis.II. Classification In this step all test cases need to be classifiedas dependent or independent. If the number of dependent andindependent test cases is very different then this step maysuffer from an imbalanced dataset and therefore a special algo-rithm which can handle it should be applied. Otherwise otherclassification algorithms can be utilized in this step.Since the data preprocessing might have a significant impact onthe generalization performance of supervised machine learning al-gorithms Kotsiantis et al.  thus the input data need to bepreprocessed in an early stage of the proposed solution in this study.Data preprocessing can be performed in the form of data cleaningdata integration transformation and reduction. However based onthe data type size and quality one or more of the mentioned datapreprocessing methods need to be applied to the raw data. Since theinput data in this study is manual integration test cases written in anatural text determinately we applied tokenization on the original testcases to process the raw data. Table  shows the tokenized version ofthe presented test case in Table .In Section . Experimental Setup we provide more details regard-ing the utilized data preprocessing in the current study.Excluding the text from each test case a ground truth GT forthe training set is required as we are using a classification algorithmto address the problem supervised learning. As can be observed inFig.  there are two possible scenarios where our methodology canbe used having a least  of the data already labeled or having aprevious similar project with  of the examples labeled. Given thatwe intend to apply this methodology in a real industrial context thedivision between training and test sets needs to be carefully chosen. Thecommon choices are   or  at most. Howeverit is not realistic to ask the experts to label   or even  ofthe test cases. This would be a time-consuming process leading themto reject our methodology. Having this in mind we propose that thecompany takes the responsibility of labeling  of the data which willbe used to train the model. It is important that the  of the test caseschosen to be labeled represents the complete dataset. In other wordsthe distribution between dependent and independent test cases in thesample and in the whole dataset should be similar.To decide the training size as  we did experimentation withdifferent possibilities      and so on. The resultsstart to increase in . That is why we recommend  as theminimum percent of labeled data when using our methodology. Dueto page restriction this study is not included in the paper.Next we describe our methodology for both mentioned steps indetail. Fig.  represents a generic overview of the methodology pro-posed in this study for classifying dependent and independent manualintegration test cases.As we can see in Figs. a and b the discussed steps are mappedwith step  and step . Moreover the raw data need to be processedbefore we apply each of the mentioned steps. As stated earlier in thissection there are several ways to process raw data for supervisedlearning purposes. However in the described case in this study sincethe input is test cases that are written in a natural text thus all test casesneed to be tokenized in advance. As can be seen in Fig. a for thefirst scenario just  of all test cases are used since  of the datais labeled before wherein Fig. b  of test cases are employed.We need to consider that regardless of the utilized data portion or  all raw data manual integration test cases in the presentstudy need to be preprocessed tokenized in this case as a part of theproposed methodology in this study. Input Our methodology has been designed to operate from twotypes of entries\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   Fig. .

Data Preprocessing As the natural language test cases are com-monly stored in various rich text formats and even spreadsheetsthe text is extracted from them. The text is then preprocessedusing standard tokenization methods to remove the majority ofpunctuation and convert all the text to lowercase. Step  Latent semantic analysis technique then reads the textdocuments and provides a set of vectors with -dimensional fea-tures where each vector represents a text document. This stepcan be performed by using various implementations of neuralembedding models for text analysis such as Gensim Rehurekand Sojka  Paragraph vectors see Section .. andfastText Joulin et al. . Step  Applying supervised learning on the imbalanced dataprovided from step  each vector is classified into one of the twoclasses. This step can be performed by using various implementa-tions of the mentioned imbalance approaches in Section .. Output For each test case to be classified a class label is auto-matically assigned.At the end of the procedure all test cases from the initial dataset areassigned to either independent or dependent class.. Industrial Case studiesThis section analyzes the feasibility of the proposed methodol-ogy which has been done through studying two on-going testingprojects  and  at Bombardier Transportation BT in Sweden. Alldesigned requirements and test case specifications for the two projectsare extracted from DOORS database at BT... Case studiesThe units of analysis in these case studies are requirements andtest specifications at the integration testing level for projects  and where for both projects there exists the ground truth. Table represents some additional information about the projects. As we cansee the number of independent test cases is different for the twoprojects which emphasizes the need for an automated approach fordependency detection. Rational Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System which is arequirement management tool.Moreover there is a considerable imbalanced ratio between inde-pendent and dependent test cases in both projects  and . Accordingto Table  the number of independent test cases for project  is equal to whereas the number of dependent test cases for this project is equalto . On the other hand the number of independent test cases forproject  is equal to  whereas the dependent test cases is equalto  for this project. The inserted information in Table  indicatesthat the dependency detection problem suffers from an imbalancedclassification problem... The ground truthAs stated earlier the dependencies between requirements and testcases are detected by analyzing the signal communications betweensoftware modules Tahvili et al. b. In this regard the structure ofthe Train Control Management System TCMS which is the testing plat-form at BT is analyzed by us. Fig.  shows a part of the TCMS platformwhere the traceability graph between software modules requirementsand test cases is visible.As we can be seen in Fig.  two test cases are functionally dependenton each other if the output internal signal from the correspondingsoftware module enters as an input internal signal to another corre-sponding software module. Indeed if there exists any shared internalsignal between two software modules transmitting and receiving thesame internal signal then these two modules are depending on eachother. Thereby there is a dependency between all requirements andtest cases that are assigned to test those software modules. For instanceTC is functionally dependent on TC because an internal signal fromModule enters to Module. The proposed approach in Tahvili et al.b was applied on both projects  and  and the results areutilized in this paper as the ground truth where we know the depen-dencies between test cases. Since the provided information in Fig.  isnot available for all testing projects we need to employ other method-ologies for detecting the dependencies between test cases. However thetest cases are usually available and detecting the dependencies throughanalyzing them might be applicable in different industries.As highlighted earlier the presented results in Tahvili et al. bFig.  in the current study are utilized here as the ground truth forlabeling the vectors provided by DocVec. In the example presented inFig.  we have a dataset of test cases and we want our model to identify\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   than . with spaces. For the example for the test case inTable  this produces output presented in Table . To associate featurevectors with documents we used DocVec Mikolov et al.  Ilenic method which trains neural networks using the content of thedocument and extracts the values from a layer of neurons as featurevectors. We generated  real-value features for each document over training epochs. Increasing the number of features or trainingepochs in our case did not yield more accurate results.The rest of the parameters were as follows the batch was set to  noise words were used to sample from the noise distribution and thelearning rate was set to ..In this experiment we use -fold cross validation applying a semi-supervised classification method. The semi-supervised classification ap-plies to problems where the number of labeled examples the trainingsample is less than the unlabeled examples the test sample. Weattempted to show that although only  of the ground truth isavailable it is still possible to classify the remaining test cases. Toclassify the feature vectors and consequently the test cases we usedKEEL Triguero et al. . KEEL is a software tool developed inJava that provides the implementation of the most relevant state of theart data mining algorithms. This tool has a module called Imbalancedlearning. All the algorithms used in our comparative analysis areimplemented in this module. The data partitions used in our studyhave been made using the KEEL module Data Management. In thisway we guarantee a uniform distribution of examples by classes foreach partition Triguero et al. . Any interested reader can easilyreproduce our proposal.The original data distribution in project  is  examples in theminority class and  examples in the majority. When the data issplit for the cross validation we get the following data distribution examples in the minority class and  examples in the majority classwith an imbalance ratio of ..We also provide all experimental setup data description and param-eters and lastly we present and discuss the obtained results... ParametersFor our experimental study we select ten from the  main groupsof solutions of the most representative algorithms for imbalanceddomain. All the selected algorithms have shown good performance inprevious studies.As we mentioned before our experiments can be perfectly repro-ducible by any interested reader. In this regard Table  presents theparameters which have been used in this study. For each methodthe parameters shown in Table  are the ones recommended by theauthors and thus the ones used in our experimental study. Regardingto IFROWANN classifier the authors propose  configurations of thealgorithm as a result of combining  t-norms and  weighting strategies.In this study we use an average fuzzy relation as the authors suggest.Moreover we apply three weighted strategies namely   and given that those are the ones recommended by the authors when theimbalance ratio is low.Usually the companies have several projects with the same char-acteristics especially in regard to the distribution between dependentand independent test cases. Due to the fact that we know the labelsof all test cases in this specific case we proceed to the experimentalstudy using cross validation. We use a -fold cross validation and aswe mentioned before only  of the data is trained which is thentested on the remaining .Table  shows the results of the  IFROWANN configurations foreach of the  partitions as well as the average. As we can see the bestIFROWANN configuration is obtained for    which will be usedfor the performance comparison with other algorithms. Moreover the Knowledge and Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning. Available at httpsscis.ugr.eskeelindex.php.Fig. .

Since we only have two classes we need to usea binary classifier. In other words we need to decide whether if a testcase is dependent class  or not dependent class  from any of theother test cases. For instance in the above-mentioned example TC islabeled as a dependent class .In the upcoming section the feasibility of the proposed methodol-ogy is evaluated by comparing the obtained results in this study withthe ground truth. From the ground truth also presented in Table  weknow that our dataset in Project A has  instances from which are independent majority class and only  are dependent minorityclass. As we explained before this means that the datset suffers from aclass imbalance problem with an imbalance ratio of . using Eq. .Indeed there are more than four independent test cases for each de-pendent test case Tahvili et al. . Using the signal information inFig.  helped us to visualize the dependency relationships between testcases via requirements which has been partially mirrored in Fig. .This figure highlights that detecting the dependencies between testcases red nodes is very challenging therefore applying an automatedapproach can help testers and test managers to rank test cases forexecution in a more efficient way.. Experimental evaluationIn this section we evaluate the performance of our methodologyusing two projects from Bombardier Transportation Sweden. The eval-uation is performed in two parts the first part will contain an overallevaluation of the proposed methodology through applying a semi-supervised classification method Isaac et al. . In the second partwe evaluate the proposed methodology using unseen data... Experimental setupThe test cases were obtained as a set of Microsoft Excel documentsfrom which we removed formatting and extraneous information. Firstwe extract only the initial state and test steps actions and reactionsas shown in Table  as pure text.

From this experimental study wecan conclude that despite the fact that    is highly recommendedby IFROWANN authors for low imbalance problems when the trainingset is much smaller than the test set     does not have the betterperformance.As we explained before standard classification methods tend to bebiased by the class most represented. This is due to the optimizationof global metrics such as error or accuracy which do not take intoaccount the distribution of the instances by classes. As a result of thisnotably precision is achieved in the class that is represented most whilethe instances concerning the lesser represented class tend to be poorlyclassified. In all the utilized methods we use the parameters which arerecommended by the authors.In imbalanced learning the area under the Receiver Operating Char-acteristic ROC curve known as AUC area under curve is a verycommon metric for showing the diagnostic ability of a binary clas-sifier. Indeed the ROC curve plots the rate of correctly classifiedminority instances against the rate of incorrectly classified majorityinstances Huang and Ling  and the AUC represents the trade-offbetween them Fawcett .Table  represents the AUC values of the selected approaches fromstate of the art algorithms using the presented data in Table  fromproject  at BT. As highlighted in Table  IFROWANN shows anoutstanding result AUC  . compared to all other approaches.Moreover CS-SVM has the highest AUC among the selected classifica-tion methods. In conclusion the presented results in Table  can help usto put the rest of the classification methods into the same level  AUC  . In the next subsection the performance of all presentedmethods in Table  is studied on another testing project at BT used asunseen data... Model evaluation using unseen dataIn order to assess the generalizability of the proposed methodologyin this study the data of another testing project at Bombardier trans-portation is collected as unseen data. In fact the ability to perform well\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   Table AUC results for the state of the art classification methods.In order to evaluate the proposed dependency detection method-ology on a set of unseen data project  the following steps areconducted. A number of  requirement specifications and  test speci-fications are extracted from the DOORS database.. The ground truth for the dependency between requirements andthereby test cases is detected via using sOrTES Tahvili et al... All test case specifications are inserted to the DocVec.. The provided vectors by DocVec are used as an input to theimbalanced classification method in order to train the algorithm.. The test cases from project  are used as a target for dependencydetection using the imbalanced classification method.. The provided dependent and independent classes by imbalancelearning are then compared with the ground truth for the project.. The steps  to  are repeated for the various imbalanced clas-sification algorithms and then the results are compared seeTable .The AUC values using unseen data are summarized in Table which indicates that IFROWANN performance on unseen data is goodAUC  . and is still superior than all other methods. Thus theproposed methodology is likely to accommodate other projects withinthe same domain. From this experimental study we infer that whenthe training set is sufficiently large  implying that the domain of thevariables are well covered    and    show the best results.Nevertheless    proved to be the most stable configuration inboth experiments. Furthermore    presents the highest differencein performance. This is due to the definition of the weighting vectorssince for    the weight values of the majority class decrease morerapidly than in the other configurations.Additionally Fig.  represents the harmonic relationship betweenthe false positive and true positive rates using the proposed method-ology in this study. Each point represents the rates of false positiveand true positive for a specific threshold. The closer the curve is to thetop-left corner the better the algorithms performance. Indeed Fig. shows the probability of dividing test cases into two classes dependentand independent test cases using unseen data... Threats to validityFinally we discuss the validity threats the research limitations andchallenges in conducting the present study. Construct validity addresses if the study measures what weintend it to measure Robson and McCartan . The majorFig. . Partial dependency graph for the requirements and test cases for project . Theblue nodes represent requirements and the red nodes test cases. For interpretation ofthe references to color in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web versionof this article.on unseen data can provide some clues for the model generalizationwhich is the desirable characteristic of any demanded model Wohlinet al. .To obtain this target all designed requirements and test cases forproject  are utilized. The size of the captured data for the project  isalready presented in Table . The dependencies between requirementsand thereby test cases for the project  are detected through usingour tool sOrTES. Fig.  shows the dependency between requirementsblue nodes and thereby test cases red nodes for the project . Inother words the ground truth for the dependencies between test casesexists for the performance evaluation of the proposed methodology. Itshould be kept in consideration that the testing team which works onthe project  is completely different from the project . Thus there isno common test case between these two projects. Moreover the waythat the testers wrote the test cases is slightly different. Nonetheless alltest cases are designed to test trains which means that both have thesame number of sub-level function groups SLFG. The number of testcases as well as the ratio of dependent and independent test cases arecompletely different see Table . Stochastic Optimizing TEstcase Scheduling see Tahvili et al. . More details can be found in the original paper Ramentol et al. .\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   Table AUC results of the state of the art classification methods wherethe model is trained on the project  and tested on the project.Fig. . ROC curve analysis for classifying test cases into dependent and independent.construct validity threat in the present study is the way that thevectors are obtained from the DocVec tool. Writing test casesin a more formal way might directly affect the performance ofDocVec. Since test cases are written by the testers some param-eters such as language skill domain knowledge and experienceinfluence the quality of the test cases. This issue is even obviousin the presented results. Our analysis indicates that the test casesfrom project  are created with higher quality when compared toproject . Internal validity addresses the conclusions of the study Runesonand Hst . In order to reduce the threats to internal validitya diverse number of state of the art algorithms are applied and theobtained results are compared. External validity refers to the generalization of the findingsWohlin et al. . The proposed methodology in this studyhas been applied to only two industrial testing projects in therailway domain however it should be applicable to other similarcontexts in other testing domains. Since the classification steps aredesigned for solving imbalanced datasets the proposed method-ology can also be applied for solving other imbalanced problemsas well. Moreover the context information has been provided inSection  to enable comparison with other proposed approachesin the testing domain. Conclusion validity addresses the factors which can affect theobservations and may lead to an inaccurate conclusion Cozbyand Rawn . Utilizing the humans judgment decision andsupervision might decrease this threat. Since the proposedmethodology in this study is designed and developed for anindustrial usage at Bombardier a close collaboration and dialoguewith the subject mater experts SME is established in order toensure the industrys requisite and needs. Moreover the detectedresults independent and dependent test cases are presented in afew project meetings at BT. Reliability addresses the repeatability and consistency of thestudy Runeson and Hst . The text analysis step of thisstudy is very sensitive and relies on the way that test cases aredesigned which is usually a common problem faced by manyresearchers in the area of natural language processing. In con-sultation with the SMEs at BT a set of wrongly spelled wordswere found in the test case specifications. Thus the data in theDOORS database sometimes contains ambiguity uncertainty andspelling issues which have a direct impact on the performanceof the DocVec tool. DocVec searches for semantic similarity forproviding the vectors. In the case that no semantic similarity isfound between two test cases they will end up as independenttest cases later on. This issue can directly impact the accuracy ofthe proposed solution. In addition most of the language parsingtechniques have some performance issues when a large set of dataneeds to be processed. There are demerits in the available toolsfor natural language processing.. Concluding remarksIn this paper we present a novel methodology for splitting man-ual test cases into dependent and independent classes. The proposedmethodology uses neural networks model for natural language process-ing and imbalanced learning for the classification task. Our proposalhas been validated in two real industrial case studies in BombardierTransportation Sweden.We make the following contributions.I. From a machine learning point of view A novel two-steps methodology is proposed. DocVec proves to be a good tool when transforming themanual test cases into feature vectors. IFROWANN performs well when splitting dependent andindependent test cases as an imbalance learning algorithm.II. From a software testing point of view It is possible to classify with an acceptable accuracy thetest cases of a project as dependent or not from onlyknowing  of the ground truth. By having the ground truth of a previous project it ispossible to classify all the test cases of an unseen projectwith a high accuracy. The membership degree to the minority class providedby IFROWANN called   can be used to define anexecution order.We highlight that the proposed methodology is not limited to soft-ware testing. It can be applied in other types of problems where a setof text documents should be split into two main classes with a highprobability of class imbalance data such as use Liu et al. .The main future direction of this study is tool making. Previouslywe designed implemented and developed two tools ESPRET Tahvili EStimation and PRediction of Execution Time.\\x0cS. Tahvili L. Hatvani E. Ramentol et al.Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence   et al. a and sOrTES Tahvili et al.  for execution time pre-diction and test scheduling respectively. Both tools are utilized at BTtoday which in turn help us to modify our tools. Having an automatedtool for dependency detection is demanded by our industrial partnerand can be used for different purposes such as test automation testselection and prioritization. Furthermore the dependencies betweeneach and every test case need to be detected as well. Hitherto all testcases are divided into two main classes. The independent test cases canbe executed without order or parallel with other test cases but theexecution order of the dependent class of test cases needs to be detectedin the future.Another future direction of this work is to reduce the training seteven more e.g.  or  instead of  and also applying differentarchitecture in the word embeddings such as the proposed adaptationof the Skip-gram model by Ye et al. . Moreover other text miningalgorithms such as string-matching token-based edit-based algorithmse.g. Levenshtein distance that previously employed for similarity de-tection between test cases Landin et al.  can be considered as areplacement for the text analysis step of this work.The goal is to minimize the human efforts and judgment for datalabeling. Furthermore in the limit we have planned to apply someunsupervised learning approaches such as clustering. However the fea-sibility of the proposed methodology needs to be analyzed on differentindustrial testing projects.Buda M. Maki A. Mazurowski M. .

IntroductionProcedures play a key role in ensuring safe deliberate andcontrolled operations at a facility by broadly supporting the activ-ities of its personnel e. They provide the interface between theequipment and the personnel who operate and maintain them .They also play an intermediary role in the transfer of knowledgefrom system engineers to the operators of the system and even fortraining purposes . Furthermore relevant procedures supportthe plant managers understanding of how exactly to meet thestandards and expectations for the operation and maintenance ofthe plant .Procedures must be technically and operationally accurateintegrating the up-to-date knowledge available in all relevantareas which include the requirements policies physical facilitiesprocesses and people necessary to operate the facility safely .In addition the controlled documents of procedures must be easyto follow to ensure human performance quality by clearly providingthe purpose specic intent and sequenced direction for an activityprogram or process .

Broad requirements for managing procedure programsAs depicted in Fig.  the IAEA-TECDOC- placed proceduresas a major component of the conguration information program. It emphasized that procedures need to be consistent with othercomponents in a timely manner to ensure that safe technicallysound and cost-effective decisions are made with condence. TheIAEA-TECDOC- aimed to provide good practices with respectto the development and the use of NPP procedures based on thehistoric lessons learned from NPPs and utilities . More specif-ically it presented foundational issues of procedure system devel-opment methodology.The U.S. Department of Energy DOE also emphasized the roleof procedures as a key component for the overall safe operation of afacility. The DOE-STD-- Writers Guide for Technical Pro-cedures  dened the broad requirements for managing pro-cedure programs and provided guidance on the process ofdeveloping and maintaining the procedures at DOE facilities. Itintroduced detailed issues regarding the processes involved inwriting technical procedures which include establishing the basiscontent and format of a procedure and writing and structuring theaction steps.The Procedure Professionals Association PPA has developedvoluntary consensus standards AP-- Procedure WritersManual  in conjunction with AP-- Procedure ProcessDescription . The U.S. DOE concluded that those PPA documentsadequately fullled the purpose of DOE-STD-- and endorsedthe PPA as suitable for further work on those issues . The AP-- provides a nuclear industry consensus standard for writinghuman-factored procedures with elaborately developed specicguidelines. These guidelines are considered the de facto standardsby many U.S. commercial NPPs and other industrial plantsworldwide.A large number of technical procedures are needed for diverseNPP components requiring large number of people in the devel-opment and improvement of procedures. Their technical back-grounds and work experiences with specic components arediverse and their understandings of the requirements of proced-ures are not necessarily the same. Thus coherent review of appli-cablehumanperformance challenges as well as technical contents of proceduresis a challenging task . This study was motivated by a desire toreduce the burden of these tasks and to make the process moreexperiencesoutstandingoperatingissuesefcient for the development and maintenance of sound andeffective procedures... NLP-based information extraction integrated with rules anddomain ontologyInformation extraction is the process by which data frommachine-readable documents is selectively structured and com-bined . In general natural language processing NLP techniqueis employed to analyze the texts in the input documents beforeextracting their information. Information extraction enables muchricher forms of queries on the abundant unstructured sources thanpossible with keyword searches alone .Information extraction approaches are classied into two maintypes knowledge engineering and automatic training .the domainKnowledge engineering KE approach utilizesknowledge of human expertise represented in a machine-understandable form. The domain knowledge is often repre-sented in the form of production rules mostly in the form ofCommon Pattern Specication Language CPSL grammar  or itsderivatives like Java Annotation Patterns Engine JAPE grammar. Each patternaction rule consists of conditional patterns andaction statements for annotation. Thus the KE approach is alsoreferred to as a rule-based approach. Rules are iteratively con-structed and rened to improve the accuracy of text processing. The automatic training approach also known as the machinelearning ML approach utilizes ML algorithms. In general the MLapproach requires a large amount of annotated training data onwhich its performance is dependent and often results in incon-sistent and insufcient outcomes . The KE approach tends toyield higher performance which is explained by the assertion thathuman expertise often results in more accurate patterns andextraction rules . The efforts required for dening patterns anddeveloping rules in the KE approach are expected to be less thanthose required for manually annotating a sufciently large size oftraining data in the ML approach .A domain-specic information extraction results in more suit-able outcomes than when applied to general non-technical textsdue to the reduction in homonym conicts and co-reference reso-lution problems and the enhanced interpretability of domain-specic texts . Domain-specic information extraction meth-odologies are often integrated with domain ontologies to enhancetheir performances . An ontology is a specication ofknowledge in a certain domain. It includes machine-interpretabledenitions of concepts in the domain and relations among themFig. . Conguration equilibrium diagram with related programs .Please cite this article as Y. Choi et al. Syntactic and semantic information extraction from NPP procedures utilizing natural languageprocessing integrated with rules Nuclear Engineering and Technology httpsdoi.org.j.net...\\x0cY. Choi et al.  Nuclear Engineering and Technology xxx xxxx xxxwhere each concept is associated with a set of its own instanceentities . Ontology building also known as ontology learning isapproached in several ways depending on the techniques usedincluding statistics linguistics machine learning and logical infer-ence and hybrid methods. A detailed review of such approachescan be found in Ref. .There have been applications of the NLP techniques in the nu-clear industry for checking conformance to requirement templatesidentifying causal relationships from event reports answering natural language search queries in the nuclear domain utilizing Google BERT  etc. Applications of ontologiescould be found in the nuclear industry e as well as in otherindustries e. Fig. a shows a part of the hierarchical rep-resentation of NPP components  utilizing Protcidegcide  Fig. billustrates relationships among major NPP components . For each table the structural information including the nestingrelation is noted and any image object in the table is handled inthe same manner as above. For each text paragraph including those in tables which is aseries of texts ending with a hard return by the Enter key itsstructural properties text index bullet offset etc. and rich textfeatures typeface size color underline etc. are extracted.Additional structural properties parent paragraph texts atmargins index level etc. are also extracted. Each text para-graph is converted into a new instance of the paragraph classwhich is the main data structure of the iExtractor. This datastructure will be enriched by further storing all the informationextracted at each step of the proposed method to its corre-sponding slots.. The methodology and the software tool iExtractor.. Natural language processing phaseThe iExtractor automatically captures the syntactic and semanticinformation from the input procedures in three phases pre-processing natural language processing and the main phase ofinformation extraction. All the three phases are implemented inMicrosoft C employing some publicly available software compo-nents at the rst two phases. Compared with related systems likethe ANNIE system of GATE  and Stanford NER  the iExtractorhas unique features to extract more valid information from pro-cedures. These include enhancement of POS tagging classicationof paragraph types and identication of step statement compo-nents each integrated with its own rule set. This section brieydescribes the steps of the iExtractor... Pre-processing phaseThe iExtractor system preprocesses the input procedure as fol-lows utilizing the API tools provided by the word processor soft-ware e.g. the Microsoft Word Reader API  For each image object gures drawings charts etc. its loca-tion is marked and stored separately for further processing.The iExtractor system utilizes publicly available natural languageprocessing tools in accordance with the language used to describethe procedures such as the Stanford CoreNLP Toolkit  or OpenKorean Text  which support the following sub-steps in general.Fig.  at the end of section  illustrates the stepwise outcomes ofthe selected steps in sections . and . for the target statementshown in its rst row.... Tokenization sentence splitting and lemmatizationThe NLP tool rst splits each text paragraph into tokens of textsand then into sentences. If the word contained in a token is ininectional or derivational form then the root form of the word isalso provided to the token. More detailed descriptions for the threesub-steps follow Tokenization splits texts into separate tokens each contain-ing any type of text such as a word a number a punctuationmark a symbol etc. . A token could be associated withadditional attributes for the text it contains such as its lengththe start and the end position indices.

Lemmatization utilizes morphological analysis to derive theroot form of each word in inectional form or in derivationalform . Lemmatization helps to look up the instances ofin the inputconcepts not represented in the root formprocedure.... Part-of-speech POS tagging and parsingPOS tagging is the task of labeling each token with its part-of-speech such as noun verb adverb. Parsing is the process of con-structing a hierarchical structure tree of tokens for each sentence. The third row of Fig.  illustrates the POS tags for the tokensrepresented in the second row. Table A in Appendix A providesdescriptions of the tags and relation labels used in this paper inalphabetical order and their full lists are provided in Ref. .There are two forms of parse trees the constituency-based andthe dependency-based. A constituency-based parse tree shows thehierarchical structure of the constituents each as a group of to-kens by the phrase structure grammar . Fig. a for instanceshows the constituency-based parse tree for the statement shownin the rst row of Fig. . In Fig. a each leaf node is the POS tag fora token with its text represented at the bottom whereas each non-leaf node is a constituent tag. A dependency-based parse tree is adirected tree with nodes of lexical tokens where each directed edgerepresents the grammatical relation between a pair of nodes .Fig. b shows the dependency-based parse tree for the samestatement in Fig. a. In Fig. b each label on an edge indicatesthe grammatical role of the child token to the parent tokendescribed in Table A in Appendix A.... POS tagging enhancementNeither the POS tag of a word nor the parse tree of a sentence isunique. Existing tools recommend the most probable one based onsome metric from multiple possible choices for each word orsentence respectively . Thus for general unstructured sen-tences without any annotated reference corpus a tool-drivenevaluation for the POS tags and the parse trees is meaningless. Any evaluation and correction of a tag for a token andor aparse tree for a sentence requires manual work .For procedures however many domain-specic terminologiesare utilized. In addition each step statement is represented in asemi-structured form mostly in an imperative form and possiblypreceded by additional components. Some words of syntactic orsemantic importance such as conditional or logic terms actionverbs or codes are capitalized as a way of emphasis purpose. Thosespecial features of procedures often limit the performance of POStagging and parsing and further the performance of the nal in-formation extraction .The iExtractor system evaluates the POS tags for tokens utilizinga customized lexical database for NPPs which is a miniatureversion of Wordnet  and the special features of procedurestatements. Misinterpreted POS tags are detected and corrected bysimple built-in rules integrated with the lexical database.Fig.  below shows the initial parse tree for a statement ofIt is shown that the tokens of THEN and REPLACE are wronglytagged as NNP proper noun singular  and VBPverb non-rd person singular present  respectively. ConsequentlyTHEN is also wrongly interpreted as the nominative of the verbREPLACE that is its constituent tag is wrongly assessed asNPnoun phrase .rulestaggingenhancementassociated withFig.  shows the enhanced parse tree after applying one of thePOStheIF  conditions THEN actions statement type in whichthe tag for the token of THEN is changed into RBadverb .This rule-based POS tag correction for a token leads to additionalchanges of tags for other tokens and constituents by re-parsing thestatement. The POS tag for the token of REPLACE is changed intoVB verb base form  and the constituent tag of THEN ischanged into ADVP adverb phrase  which are now inaccordance with what the statement implies...Information extraction phaseUtilizing the outcomes of the rst two phases three types ofinformation are extracted for each paragraph via correspondingsteps semantic entities paragraph types and step statementcomponents. The last type of extraction is used only for applicableparagraph types to be described in section ...... Semantic entity taggingThis step annotates selected words in each paragraph with theirsemantic type in two sub-steps rst by ontology lookup and thenby built-in rules. Through the ontology lookup any tokens con-taining words matched with an instance entity in the ontology aretagged as the corresponding concept. The fourth row of Fig. Fig. .

The enhanced parse tree after applying rule-based POS tagging correction.illustrates the lookup tags or annotations for the tokens repre-sented in the second row.The following lists of concepts were introduced to the ontologyin association with the three questions that need to be answered foraction step statements cid WHO performs the specic task - organization division rolestaffcid WHAT task is to be performed - action verb structure systemcomponent and part SSCPcid HOW to correctly perform the task in a safe and efcient manner -tool material measure measure unit criteria status.Additionallists of concepts were also introduced as thosefrequently appear in actual procedures such as documents andcodes. The initial set of instance entities of each concept both inEnglish and in Korean was developed utilizing multiple sourcessuch as  and the actual procedures. The sets of conceptsand lists of instance entities of each concept have passed throughseveral iterations of improvement in cooperation with domainexperts  reecting newly collected evidences .Action verbs are key elements of step statements that describedirectives to be performed by the procedure user. They are identi-ed not by simple ontology lookup but as verbs satisfying all of thefollowing conditionscid A verb in base form without conjunction with tocid A verb neither associated with a nominative nor in conjunctionwith another verb having a nominativecid In the case of the verb have it is not involved with any tensesuch as present perfect tense.Lookup-based tagging annotates only the tokens matched withthe semantic entities included in the ontology. However anontology contains only some limited set of representative entitiesfor a certain problem area in a specic domain. The iExtractor sys-tem utilizes the rule-based semantic annotation where any to-kens satisfying the conditions of a rule isare tagged with theconcept designated by that rule . Both syntactic and semanticfeatures of texts were employed in the rules. For semantic entitiesmissed by the ontology lookup and by the current rule set theontology is expanded with their representative entities  orthose procedure statement patterns are transformed into newpatternaction rules . For wrongly tagged semantic entitiesthe corresponding rules are rened .As an example the following rule represented by CPSL grammar designates a new SSCP instance as the consecutive tokensof nouns plus a succeeding SSCP instance found by the ontologylookup.The fth row of Fig.  illustrates a new semantic tag annotatedby the above rule. The tokens of Pump Switch tagged as an SSCPentity by the ontology lookup are preceded by two consecutivesingular proper nouns each POS tagged as NNP as shown in thethird row of Fig. . Then the above rule annotates this compoundnoun of four tokens of words Flow Station Pump Switch as a newSSCP entity represented in the fth row of Fig. ....

Choi et al.  Nuclear Engineering and Technology xxx xxxx xxxwhich specically indicates how it is to be further processed. Briefdescriptions of each paragraph type classied into three groupsare provided below.First each paragraph that contains action verbs and targetobjects is classied into the step group. Specic types of para-graphs belonging to this group based on the syntactic or semanticcomponents shown in Fig.  include the followingcid A non-conditional action step typically starts with an actionverb possibly preceded by additional components of criticalinformation andor an adverb.cid A branching step GO TO  or PROCEED TO  or a referencing stepREFER TO  SEE  USE  REPEAT  or PER is a special form ofstep that starts with those designated action verbs.cid A conditional action step IFWHEN  conditions THEN ac-tions or a continuous action step WHILEIF AT ANYTIME  conditions actions is a special form of a stepwhich starts with those designated keywords. The conditionscould be a compound of multiple conditional clauses eachconnected with another one by a logical operator e.g. AND or alist of conditional clauses after the clause including like any ofthe following. The actions clause is usually in a form of anaction step.The second group of paragraphs includes the following that areclosely related with specic action stepscid Each statement following NOTE CAUTION or WARNING eachto be classied as a NCW header is to be classied as an NCWstatement. Each of those is placed prior to relevant steps andshall not contain any directive .cid The paragraph of HOLD POINT or in the form preceded with atopical keyword like QA HOLD POINT is classied as a holdpoint type.cid In some steps it is required to record the observed data andfurther the calculated valuess utilizing a simple formulainvolving newly observed data. Such paragraphs placed afterrelevant step statements are classied as a record row or acalculation row respectively. A signoff could be represented asan independent paragraph to be classied as a signoff row.cid In case any logical operator itself builds a paragraph it is clas-sied as a logical operator. A list element is each paragraph inbullet form listed typically after the step statement containingthe following.The third group of paragraphs are not intrinsically related tospecic action stepscid The subsection title and the caption of a gure or a table.cid The continuation heading which denotes a page break that a stepcontinues onto another page.cid The nal information type is for paragraphs that are not any ofthe above types....Identication of step paragraph componentsAccording to PPA  a step statement is decomposed into sixcomponents as shown in Fig. . Two mandatory core componentsthe action verbs and the target objects and four optional ones inbrackets. These components are all identied by the iExtractorsystem from any paragraph of those ve types belonging to the rststep group.For this purpose this step also utilizes the built-in rules asso-ciated with the prior extracted tags for tokens. The conditions ofeach rule are expressed with POS tags constituent tags and rela-tion tags of tokens. For each paragraph the iExtractor nds the rulematching the current paragraph and identies the componentsdesignated by that rule. As an example the following rule identiesthree components of action verb target object and supportinginformation from a paragraph of action step type matched with allthree conditions.The sixth row of Fig.  illustrates the three statement compo-nents identied by the above rule. From Fig. a and b it can bededuced that the three conditions of the above rule hold with fourarguments of TURN as av FCEDS as to Flow Station PumpSwitch as to and to the ON position as si. Thus the above ruledesignates the three componentsfrom the left to the rightrespectively as av to  to and si as shown in the sixth row ofFig. .All the information extraction results are stored into a databaseand are produced in various additional forms by the iExtractorsystem. Fig.  shows two examples of those a the proceduredocument with semantic entities highlighted in different colorsaccording to their concepts and b the procedure document withparagraphs highlighted in different colors according to their types.Procedures are important assets of a specic facility and are notallowed to be disclosed. Thus the color-highlighted procedures inFig.  are only for illustration applied to a sample procedureintroduced in Refs. . Various outputs provided by the iExtractorsystem including those in Fig.  are also utilized to collect feedbackon the information extraction results from domain experts and toimprove its performance by extending the ontology and the rules.. Case study resultsThe methodology and the software iExtractor introduced insection  have been applied to twenty-ve procedures obtainedfrom a U.S. commercial NPP in two groups ten operating proced-ures OPs and fteen testing procedures TPs. This section brieyintroduces selected ndings associated with the relevant summarystatistics obtained by simple queries to the database of all the in-formation extracted from those procedures.This experimental analysis focused on the instructions sectionswhere each contained step statements.

Table  shows the valuesthe minimum the maximum and the average of the different ac-tion verbs used for each procedure in each group. From the tables itcan be seen that OPs utilized relatively more distinct action verbsthan TPs which might be because OPs have relatively more pagesthan TPs or that OPs technically require more distinct actions thanTPs. It can also be deduced that many action verbs were utilizedover multiple procedures. It is additionally shown that this plantutilized many facility-specic action verbs other than those listed inRef.  however their incidence counts are slightly lower thanthose of PPA-listed ones.Table  shows the top ve action verbs used for each proceduregroup and by the type of action verbs PPA-listed ones or facility-specic ones.cid Four of the top ve PPA-listed action verbs overlap for both OPsand TPs and they are again included in the All procedurescolumn.cid For facility-specic action verbs as expected it shows that theirincidence counts were much lower than those of the PPA-listedones. Interestingly there is no overlap between the two top vefacility-specic action verbs for OPs and for TPs.It is encouraged to use facility-specic action verbs howevereach action verb needs to be clearly dened with its necessity andshared over the entire facility . The full list of action verbs witheach incidence count provided by the iExtractor helps to rene theset of action verbs.

Variousmetrics to evaluate information extraction results have been pro-posed  however they all require domain experts manualannotation for the selected data set before or after informationextraction is applied. Without any gold standard in a specicdomain such evaluation results could be subjective . Insteadduring the case study more effort was devoted to improvingvarious outputs of the iExtractor system to detect any false ormissed results in more convenient ways e.g. a list of semanticentities annotated by rules for each origin instance entity includedin the ontology and a list of non-annotated compound nouns. Onaverage a one hundred-page procedure was processed in minutes.Preprocessing of the procedure document les takes time but it isrequired only once. Based on our experience the amount of false ormissed information was limited after several iterations of reectingfeedbacks including those on plant-specic procedure writingstyles. A more specic evaluation on the causal relationshipsamong the stepwise performances of the NLP-based applications isproposed as a topic for further study.The iExtractor system may make it easier to develop andmaintain sound and effective procedures and help to reduce theworkload involved in their management. It can provide overallcomprehension of the analyzed procedures and indicate parts ofprocedures that need improvement. The rich information extractedfrom procedures could be utilized as the basis for their enhancedmanagement.

Being among the most applicable and advancedfeatures of model-driven development model transformation could help improving one of themost time- and resource-consuming efforts in this process namely discovery and specificationof business vocabularies and business rules within the problem domain. One of our latestdevelopments in this area was the solution for the automatic extraction of SBVR businessvocabularies and business rules from UML use case diagrams which was arguably one of themost comprehensive developments of this kind currently available in public. In this paper wepresent an enhancement to our previous development by introducing a novel natural languageprocessing component to it. This enhancement provides more advanced extraction capabilitiessuch as recognition of entities entire noun and verb phrases multinary associations and betterquality of the extraction results compared to our previous solution. The main contributionspresented in this paper are pre- and post-processing algorithms and two extraction algorithmsusing custom-trained POS tagger. Based on the related work findings it is safe to state thatthe presented solution is novel and original in its approach of combining together MMtransformation of UML and SBVR models with natural language processing techniques in thefield of model-driven information systems engineering.. IntroductionIn information systems development textual specifications are used as either an alternative or a supplementary means toknowledge specification and representation. Of course when it comes to model-driven information systems development graphicalmodels are the ones playing the most important role. Nonetheless even in model driven approaches textual specification of businessdomain knowledge system design and other aspects of the project remains a crucial part of the overall documentation. This is dueto the fact that any business-oriented development project will always involve business people who will tend to communicate theirbusiness knowledge using natural language NL and will be quite cautious about any kind of formal models even if graphicaldiagrams are read by business people there will always be a risk of them misinterpreting things.Based on our extensive research work carried out in VEPSEM and VeTIS projects we argue that one of the ways of dealingwith such situation is to use both formal graphical models and their mirrored representation in textual format based on so-called Corresponding author at Department of Information Systems Kaunas University of Technology Studentu str.

Our current focus is on the integration of formal graphical and textual models of business knowledge and userrequirements residing within the early stages of information systems development. In there we use UML use case diagrams asmeans of graphical representation of a functional requirements model and for the textual representation of business knowledge weadopted SBVR standard . Now while UML requires no further introduction the acronym of SBVR is known to a much smalleraudience and therefore calls for more elaborate overview. SBVR refers to the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Ruleswhich is a formally sound standard for the specification of virtually any kind of knowledge using controlled NL. An SBVR model iscomposed of one or more business vocabularies and may contain sets of business rules which are based on the concepts defined in theaforementioned business vocabularies. Textual representation of SBVR models has the look and feel of a natural language and atthe same time these are the specifications based on Meta Object Facility MOF and therefore interpretable by computers. Moreoverstandardization of business knowledge in a form of NL-based and manageable concepts enables reuse of that knowledge throughoutthe whole system development life cycle and beyond e.g. in other projects within the same business domain.Nevertheless our personal experience from participating in actual systems development projects and also the conducted researchshow that projects quite often lack well-structured vocabularies of business concepts not to mention business rules as traceableand manageable artefacts even though the importance and usefulness of these artefacts is perceived quite well . One of the mainreasons explaining the situation is obvious  without proper tooling the development of such vocabularies from scratch will alwaysrequire considerable amount of additional effort which in some cases may be a decisive negative factor against such approach. In ourmost recent development  we used model-to-model MM transformation technology to extract well-structured SBVR businessvocabularies and business rules from formal UML use case models represented through a set of UML use case diagrams. The proposedsolution consists of two concurrent approaches namely automatic and semi-automatic which may be used selectively to achieve thebest expected result. Through experimenting  we proved that our transformation tool could fully reproduce benchmark resultsin wizard-based semi-automatic mode however fully automated transformation approach was less accurate due to its limitationswhile dealing with so-called bad modeling practices and other natural language related issues. While some of these issues are alsoaddressed within the scope of interpreting conceptual model labels Leopold  they tend to focus on processing at a single labellevel and do not consider composite artefacts such as business rules. Moreover recent achievements in natural language processingenable more advanced textual analysis parsing extraction and normalization further improving the results obtained during theinitial automated procedures. These include but are not limited to part-of-speech tagging entity extraction relation extraction andnamed entity recognition which have shown to be influential in the context of our research. The most recent achievements in thesefields present promising results .Research objectives. We argue that recent developments in natural language processing NLP and more specifically  entityextraction can be used to deliver certain improvement to the automatic model transformation. Indeed natural language processinghas been researched quite actively in the area of requirements engineering and beyond. Nevertheless at the time of writing we couldnot find a single paper describing any tangible results of performing automated extraction of natural language concepts from formalgraphical models. In this paper we present the main results of the developed NLP enhancement to our previous MM transformationsolution . In addition we show that the achieved result is generalizable to a broader context of model transformations not limitingitself to only the extraction of SBVR business vocabularies and rules from UML use case models.Hence this paper provides the following contributions to the domain of model-driven information systems development Discusses premises and issues of entity extraction from graphical models Provides an NLP-based approach to enhance the already existent model transformation solution for the extraction of SBVRbusiness vocabularies and business rules from UML use case diagrams Identifies certain premises for the further research in this topic.In the next sections of this paper the main results of our research are presented Section  describes main concepts and definitionswithin the relevant topics Section  discusses certain modeling and entity naming practices as well as the main challenges andspecificities of grammatical processing Section  presents the developed algorithms for text processing with Section  providingtheir experimental evaluation main threats to construct internal and external validity are defined in Section  Section  is anoverview of the related work finally Section  concludes the paper summarizing the results and outlining future research.. Basic definitionsThis section provides definitions of certain core concepts and some other background information relevant to the research.Section . provides definitions of a set of core SBVR concepts related to the research while Section . is dedicated to the briefcoverage of entity extraction topic... SBVR business vocabulary and business rulesBoth business and technical people benefit from using well-structured business vocabularies not only during system developmentproject but in other real-world business cases as well. Business vocabularies and business rules are used to explicitly define the coreconcepts used for expressing communicating and exchanging virtually any kind of knowledge. Semantics of Business Vocabulary andBusiness Rules  is an OMGs attempt to introduce a formalized way of dealing with the meaning representation and structure ofconcepts thus enabling automated parsing and interpretation of these concepts throughout various practical applications.\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   An SBVR model is organized in two parts business vocabulary BV and business rules BR. A business vocabulary consists ofa set of glossary-like entries representing noun concepts and verb concepts see their definitions further on that are relevant toa specific business domain. Each entry is for a single concept. The entry starts with a primary presentation denoting the name ofa concept optionally a concept can be defined by additional fields properties e.g. Definition Concept Type Synonym See. In itsturn business rules are organized in rulesets and go alongside business vocabularies.In our work we use a subset of business vocabulary concepts General concept is a noun concept which classifies things based on their common properties. Individual concept is a noun concept corresponding to an instance or a single object. Verb concept is some type of relationship between two or more noun concepts or a characteristic of the noun concept. Followingthe definition verb concepts are specified using noun concepts that were previously defined in BV. SBVR defines several typesof verb concepts however that taxonomy is not relevant to this research and therefore will not be elaborated further on.Further SBVR defines a business rule as a rule that is under business jurisdiction . However we consider this definition beingrather implicit and requiring more in-depth explanation. According to von Halle  a business rule is a logical statement that capturesthe nature of an enterprises business model defines or constrains some business aspect of particular business situation or contextand ensures that one or more business goals are achieved. SBVR specification supports both structural and operational businessrules which represent structural and behavioral assertions and constraints respectively. It must be noted that the development ofSBVR model is based on the so-called business rules mantra . It states that business rules are built on facts or verb conceptsaccording to SBVR terminology and facts are built on terms noun concepts in SBVR terminology. Verb concepts and generalconcepts form the basis of any business vocabulary successively one must have a business vocabulary to properly specify andmanage business rules.Even though SBVR is not restricted to only textual representation of SBVR concepts the main representation form is a so-calledcontrolled natural language which is also adopted in our approach. SBVR standard has explicitly defined formatting notation forthis representation form  term formatting is used to depict general concepts e.g. marketing specialist. Best practices require that general concepts aredefined in singular form using lower case letters. Name formatting represents individual concepts that usually are proper nouns and represents names towns countriescompanies etc. e.g. EUR Lithuania. The first letter of an individual concept is capitalized. verb formatting designates a verb a preposition or a combination of these two. Verbs are used in singular active or passiveforms as synonymous forms e.g. customer makes car booking and its corresponding synonymous form car booking is madeby customer keyword font represents linguistic symbols that are used to construct statements and definitions such as quantifiers if Itis obligatory that greater than that etc.The presented formatting is used for the representation of both SBVR business vocabulary concepts as well as business rules... Entity extractionEntity extraction sometimes also referred as entity chunking  is one of the core research subjects of NLP standing next torelation extraction ontology generation and enrichment and other relevant subjects within the domain of NLP. The main task ofentity extraction is recognition of presence of a word or phrase as named entity NE in a given natural language text e.g. sentencedocument. Depending of the level of complexity this task may interface with other NLP-related problems which in their turn canbe combined to form pipelines to solve the specified task General pre-processing  a subtask dealing with automated text cleansing removal of invalid symbols resolution of abbrevia-tions lemmatization etc. Error correction is performed to identify and correct typographical grammatical and semantic errors e.g. accidental use ofhomophones. Multiple approaches exist for solving this problem including multiple string distance metrics  noisy-channel models  feature-based classification  statistical machine translation  or neural machine translation techniques. However the latter techniques are tested on or address error correction at a sentence level while thispaper focuses on short phrases therefore suitability of such techniques should be verified. In our research grammatical errorprocessing is not applied. Part of speech POS tagging is an automated identification of the part of speech tags for each identified word. The existingPOS tagging solutions tend to rely on statistical and machine learning approaches such as maximum entropy classifiers conditional random fields  or deep learning . Named entity recognition NER is relatively similar to POS tagging but focuses more on the specific categories such asorganizations locations expressions of datetime. In the context of the specification of SBVR vocabularies this subtask canbe used for the identification of categories. Modern NLP tools such as Stanford CoreNLP  OpenNLP  or Spacy provide pre-trained POS taggers and customization tools.\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   Fig. . Sample parse tree for the text rumbling representing a business rule. Semantic analysis is focused on the identification of synonyms homonyms antonyms hyponyms hypernyms and othersemantic relations. Dependency resolution finds dependencies between different entities within the given text. Role extraction subtask classifies extracted NER to determine the roles of those entities. Post-processing provides additional procedures which can be applied to extracted entities normalizing replacements to singularforms for nouns or noun phrases unifying verb tenses etc.The approach introduced in this research currently applies preprocessing tokenization and POS tagging yet it can be extendedif more advanced features are required in the future.At the first look general entity extraction shares similar objectives as the extraction of business vocabularies i.e. theidentification of noun phrases and verb phrases. However there are certain differences between those two Model-specific semantics and metadata must be considered during the extraction of business vocabularies from graphicalmodels e.g. formal definitions of relationships between specific elements. The graphical language describing models is formalized and the contextual information is very concise. As a result sometextual expressions in graphical models may be grammatically incorrect. Due to this additional text processing approachese.g. grammatical error correction must be applied to ensure correct performance of POS and NER tools.Fig.  presents a sample parse tree of some business rule. This parse tree represents syntactic structure along with the taggedentities including the identified general concepts and verb concepts which are included in the SBVR business vocabulary. Themeaning of the labels presented in Fig.  are as follows in alphanumeric order BR  business rule GC  general concept IN preposition NN  singular noun PRP  pronoun VBN  past participle VBZ  rd person singular present tense verb VC verb concept WDT  WH-determiner.. Modeling practices and concept extraction challengesIn modeling application of best modeling practices is of the means to improve quality readability and common understandingof the models. In automated model processing these practices especially for naming model concepts play critical role. Section .describes a set of general modeling and naming conventions which should be taken into account when dealing specifically withuse case models. In its turn Section . presents potential issues with the existing entity extraction applications which may alsocould affect the results of automated extraction if not taken into consideration... Recommended practices for use case modelingIn our work we share and support a common understanding that a set of common standards and guidelines should be usedin any project to ensure effective communication among all interested parties. Further we will present a set of practices for UCMmodeling which are relevant to the research presented in this paper Name of an actor should be a noun or a noun phrase. In case there is more than one noun used in the name adjectives andarticles may be used in between those nouns e.g. manager of a rental. However we recommend using these parts of speechin the names of UCM concepts as little as possible and prefer so called compact representation of concepts e.g. the latterexample could be refactored to rental manager. This recommendation holds true for all the noun phrase usages within UCMnaming scheme Name of a subject system boundary should be a noun or a noun phrase Name of a use case starts with a verb and is always followed by one or more nouns verb-object label pattern. Furthermorethe name should be kept as simple as possible e.g. without cascading noun phrases or logical operators. In a broader contextthis naming convention is also embraced for activity naming and explicitly imprinted as one of the seven modeling guidelinesin process modeling  Condition of an extension point should be defined as a Boolean condition or a set of Boolean conditions connected usingBoolean operators AND OR. Ideally the formulated expression should be compliant with SBVR\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering    Association is the only allowed type of a UML relationship used between an actor and a use case. Also associations do notconvey any conditions in UCM There should be no redundant actors use cases and system boundaries with no relationships to any other concept within theUCM One should avoid using duplicate concepts representing different forms of the same entity e.g. Client  and Clients... Potential issues with entity extractionThis section presents a non-finite set of potential issues with entity extraction applications which may negatively affect theresults of model transformation if not dealt with properly. The illustrative examples in this section and further on are representedusing formalism defined in our previous paper .Part-of-speech tagger performance Grammatical forms which are not aligned with the defined naming conventions of the concepts of a use case model.Let us consider triplets of the use case model elements Actormanager UseCasesign contract Associationmanagersign contract and Actormanager UseCasecontract creation Associationmanager contract creation. Then the textrumblings extracted from these triplets would be manager sign contract  and manager contract creation. In the first casePOS tagger might fail to tag words appropriately by tagging all three of them as nouns while the second case might resultin a combined noun-phrase which would also be an incorrect result from the point of view of our MM transformation. Forthe variety of possible use case naming cases we refer to Pittke  which provides a set of activity labeling styles togetherwith POS-based syntactical structures. While those styles were originally developed for process model elements they are alsoeasily applicable for use case elements as well. False identification of nouns and verbs having homonymous forms. This issue is highly relevant to our research moreover itis a quite frequent one as well. The coincidence of the infinitive form recommended by the naming convention and the samerepresentation of a noun may lead to incorrect tagging. In such cases POS taggers tend to misidentify verbs e.g. in the textrumbling administrator log system performance the log  will be identified as a noun even though it was clearly assumed asa verb by the modeler.Modeling quality Ambiguous semantical meaning of certain model elements which cannot be automatically identified and therefore processedcorrectly. A good example of such ambiguous cases is a use case model element Actor  it can be named either starting witha capital letter e.g. Manager or with a low case letter e.g. manager. Both cases are allowed and used equally frequentlyin use case modeling. However SBVR makes it different  nouns or noun forms starting with a capital letter are identifiedas individual concepts or unitary concepts and general concepts if otherwise. Sometimes assigning ambiguous names to model elements makes it virtually impossible to identify their true meaning not onlyfor an automated system bus for the human as well. For example let us consider an extracted text rumbling analyst writingmapping   it can be interpreted both as analyst writes mapping  and analyst maps writing  or even someone maps writing ofthe analyst . In this case the result would be a natural false positive which can be correctly interpreted and validated onlyby a human analyst after examining the context.Semantic ambiguity Non-trivial identification of synonymous forms in the text. While recognition of synonymous forms can significantly improveany entity extraction task it should be noted that a safe replacement of any noun with its synonymous form may not be thatsafe at all. In our practice we found many situations where synonymous forms were actually homonyms depending on thecontext e.g. in certain situations a client  may be synonymous to both customer and desktop application however thosetwo usually represent completely different kinds of a client .Text normalization So called compact representation of the names of use cases while using specific symbols and abbreviations. One of the mostcommon cases is representing multiple elements separated by specific separators e.g. use cases registerunregister client open *.gif*.jpeg . While in many cases it will pre-processed correctly there will be exemptions that might be taken intoconsideration e.g. measure by mileshour. Various concept normalization issues especially when converting singular and plural forms e.g. should a start up be replacedwith start ups or starts up.Classifier development A term text rumbling represents an unstructured piece of textual information in a problem domain and is derived from a term business rumbling whichwas first introduced by B. von Halle in her paper Back to Business Rule Basics in Database Programming  Design  and had more specific scope thana text rumbling i.e. business domain.\\x0cP.

Issues related to training classifiers to tag instances of specific concepts such as n-ary associations which can be on virtuallyunlimited length. The lack of corpora with both grammatically and syntactically valid and invalid verb phrases is alsoconsidered to be an issue because current corpora are optimized for training classifiers which do not differentiate betweenhomonymous verb and noun forms.. NLP-enhanced extraction of SBVR business vocabulary and business rules from UML use case diagramsThis section introduces the principles of NLP-enhanced extraction of SBVR business vocabulary concepts and business rules fromUML use case diagrams. The proposed algorithms improve the automatic model transformation approach presented in our previouspaper ... Roadmap process of NLP-enhanced extractionThe overall process of NLP-enhanced extraction of SBVR specifications from UML use case diagrams is composed of fourconsequent stages Fig.  The process starts with the extraction of text rumblings from UML use case model represented via one or more UML use casediagrams. Text rumblings are extracted using a set of extraction rules fully specified in  therefore we will not elaborateon this activity The second stage is for the pre-processing of the extracted text rumblings. The pre-processing algorithm together with otherrelevant details is described in Section . Next the extraction of SBVR model from the pre-processed set of text rumblings takes place. This stage is presented inSection . The last step is for the post-processing of the generated SBVR model. The post-processing algorithm is also presented inSection .... Pre-processing and post-processing algorithmsBefore discussing the developed algorithms let us introduce certain notation elements used in those algorithms First let us denote the extracted SBVR business vocabulary as SBV and extracted SBVR business rules as SBR. Then    and    are the subsets of SBV representing general concepts individual concepts and verb conceptsrespectivelyTR is a set of text rumblings or candidates acquired from the use case model using a set of predefined model transformation rulesduring the pre-processing stageTR  r conceptTyper  conceptTyper in GC IC VC BRwhere r is a result text rumbling of the particular model transformation rule and conceptTyper is an SBVR type of that resultGC IC VC or BR. For example the given extraction result manager create contract  VC specifies that the text rumbling managercreate contract  is a candidate for an SBVR verb concept. Such formalization is required for proper identification of expected SBVRconcept types and the reduction of various ambiguities. For example let us get back to our text rumbling manager sign contract . Ingeneral this text expression could be identified as either a single general concept consisting of three nouns or a verb concept withthe sign representing a verb unfortunately in cases like this POS taggers tend to produce false positives by tagging such verbsas nouns confused by the homonymous infinitive form of those verbs. In addition we consider that traditional text preprocessingsuch as removing punctuation signs cleansing operations etc. is already performed on the acquired TR.\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering    We define      as the subset of text rumblings which are candidates for valid general and individual concepts accordingthe corresponding transformation rules similarly       and      are the subsets of text rumblings which containcandidates for valid verb concepts and business rules respectively. Lastly TR is a set of text rumblings which were obtained after applying specifically the proposed algorithm with      and      representing text rumbling sets updated after the pre-processing step.Algorithm  describes the implemented pre-processing algorithm. In this algorithm the operator replaceAll performs replacementof certain text rumblings r with values from the replaced set. Basically it extracts named entities synonymous forms and identifiesindividual concepts however their identification is a non-trivial task and should be considered as optional. The output of thealgorithm are the sets of extracted SBVR general concepts and individual concepts together with the updated text rumblings forfurther processing and acquisition of SBVR verb concepts and business rules.One of the issues with entity extraction is the resolution of conjunction and disjunction cases e.g. manager or VIP manageradministrator startrestartshutdown system. Pittke et al.  identified  anti-patterns of activity naming in the context of businessprocess modeling application of which would result in multiple elements after preprocessing with  of them related to extrainformation coming from conjunctive or disjunctive-like clauses. Hence multiple noun forms or verb phrases contained inside giventext rumblings must be split into separate atomic phrases. Moreover when forming an SBVR vocabulary these changes must bepropagated to other interrelated concepts as well e.g. changes made to general concepts must be reflected in corresponding verbconcepts and business rules.Algorithm  represents an implemented algorithm for the post-processing of the generated business vocabulary concepts andbusiness rules by propagating modifications after the re-tagging step in the extracted noun phrases and verb phrases throughoutthe whole sets of extracted verb concepts and business rules. There the notion   means that a concept  is contained inis-part-of  a concept .\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   It should be emphasized that the Algorithm  as well as the algorithms presented in Section . are consistent with theaforementioned Business Rules Mantra and closely follow the methodology described in ... Extraction algorithmsThe main idea of the NLP-enhanced extraction algorithm is the multistage application of a parser using part of speech patternson the specific chunks of text. We assume that the output of the parser is a set of tokens words labeled using Penn Treebanknotation . The grammar for these patterns is defined using ABNF notation POS_GC_MULTIPLE  POS_IC_MULTIPLE   CHAR_COND        PREP_COND      CHAR_COND        PREP_COND      ADJ_COND   _IF_COND   GC_SINGLE_COND      IC_SINGLE_COND    GC_COND  __ __   IC_COND  __ __   VERB_FORM         VERB_COND   _   _GC_COND  __ __   IC_COND  __ __   VERB_COND   _   _GC   _ _ _IC   _ _ _GC_OR_IC   _ __UNARY_VC  __  _ _BINARY_VC    _  __NARY_VC      _    __ANY_VC      _    _    __RULE_TAG  It is obligatoryIt is possibleIt is permittedIt is requiredBR     _   _     _  _      _ \\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   ... Simple cascaded extraction algorithmAlgorithm  represents a simple grammar-based chunking algorithm which sequentially processes text rumblings and identifiesinstances of general individual verb concepts and business rules in each of them. Here tagAndExtract...r operators performtagging of identified concepts in actual text rumblings the identified concepts are added to the corresponding sets. The advantageof this algorithm over generic formal grammar-based taggers is that it unifies various wording forms singularplural tenses etc.which do not coincide in different text rumblings. Additionally it can be extended to identify multiplicity cases and to insert generalquantifiers e.g. one or many at the same time propagating them to the identified SBVR model elements.The main issue with Algorithm  is that it is biased by its direct dependency on POS tagging performance and fails to identifymultiple cases where noun and verb forms are identical. This issue is addressed in the modified algorithm presented in Section ...... Stepwise cascaded extraction algorithmTo overcome the issue of misidentified POS tags we introduced certain modifications to our simple cascaded extractionalgorithm which include additional retagging steps after each stage Algorithm .In Algorithm  several moments need to be underlined. First POS retagging updates are propagated through the entire set of textrumblings. Second the extraction of business rules is performed in several stages additional extraction procedure tagAndExtract is\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   performed to ensure that the parser recognizes a complete business rule concept instead of partial which might have been extractedin previous step the latter instance is removed from  . In the current implementation retagging procedure applies a singleheuristic rule which selects the first candidate verb coming after the identified generalindividual concept. As discussed furtherone may also employ additional more sophisticated techniques to improve the quality of the results in this stage.Further Algorithm  is extended to support multinary or n-ary associations Algorithm . Here identifiedGC and identifiedICare the sets of previously identified general and individual concepts sorted in a descending order by their length i.e. the numberof contained words to satisfy the matching by the longest suffix principle. Note that this extension of the main algorithm willadd new general concepts provided they follow the pattern where nouns can be combined with the previously identified generalconcepts.As mentioned previously in this section the retagging procedure can be enhanced in multiple ways e.g. by exploiting externalcorpora using heuristic likelihood measure. Let   w be the set of all possible part-of-speech tags for word w in position t. Thenidentification of the actual part of speech of the given word w is context-dependent on the k preceding and l succeeding words.Therefore the identification of an actual POS of  would be defined as likelihood maximizationargmax               where w is the kth candidate POS of  from   w posw is the actual POS of the preceding word  posw isthe actual POS of the succeeding word . The objective is to obtain the most frequently used POS of  when  appears in thepredefined context. For example let us consider the text rumbling manager sign contract  and define context with    and   hence it would be simplified to obtaining the most frequent n-gram. If NN VB is identified as the most frequent -gram POS formanager sign then it will be preferred over NN NN  which is preferred by POS tagger by default and the sign will be retaggedto VB.. ExperimentThis section gives an overview of the experiment performed to validate the presented algorithms. Section . describes theexperiment settings and the dataset used in the experiment Section . defines a set of metrics used for the evaluation of theacquired experiment results Section . presents the main results of the experiment lastly certain conclusions on the obtainedresults are drawn in Section .... Experiment settingsThe experiment was performed using a set of both our own developments as well as tools developed by other parties All of the presented pre-processing post-processing and extraction algorithms were coded in Java programming language. The latest version of the implementation can be found at httpsgithub.compaudansbvr-extraction.\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering    Stanford CoreNLP toolkit  was used to implement the functionality of named entity recognition tokenization and POStagging. The core features of this tool are consistency with the Penn TreeBank tags and dependency parser for the recognitionof grammatical relationships between words. In addition to that CoreNLPs POS tagger makes use of log-linear conditionalMarkov models CMM  and its named entity recognition engine uses conditional random fields . During our initialexperimenting Stanford CoreNLP performed better than its close competitor Apache OpenNLP therefore we chose it asbaseline tool in our development. WordNet lexical database  was used to identify synonyms or check for existing verb forms. SimpleNLG tool  was used for the normalization of verb forms to simple present tense. The retagging procedure applieda single heuristic rule.The initial experimental dataset consisted of  UML use case models represented using UML use case diagrams. These modelswere taken from various relevant sources such as OMG UML specification popular UML books and research papers. Beforeproceeding further some of the models were refactored to meet common naming and modeling practices e.g. renaming ill-nameduse cases. In addition we decided to ignore all capital letters in the models in order to avoid confusion between actual proper nounsand general nouns written with the first capital letter e.g. an actor named as Manager instead of manager if not dealt withthis would result in false identification of SBVR individual and general concepts during the extraction process.After that sets of raw text rumblings were manually extracted from the reviewed UML models. Next corresponding sets ofbenchmark results SBVR concepts and business rules were manually acquired from these text rumblings. This whole manual processwas guided by the predefined model transformation rules presented in  and our own expert knowledge to get the best possibleresult. Lastly to automate the experiment each set of text rumblings together with corresponding benchmark results was stored asan XML document which then could be passed as an input to the developed extraction system.. Evaluation metricsThe developed extractors were evaluated in terms of precision recall and F-measure. Precision is the ratio of correctly recognizedconcepts to the number of total extracted concepts recall is a ratio of correctly recognized concepts to a number of correct concepts.By defining type       and  as t -type of a concept these results were calculated for each  as follows                           While these two metrics try two capture slightly different measures it is preferred to use harmonic mean of these two measures           A general observation about the performance of any extractor including our own developments is that the extraction results ofone stage might be influenced by the results of the preceding stages. In other words failing to recognize some general concept maylead to false extraction of certain verb concepts which are based on that general concept in the next stage and so on.For aggregate measures we use simple average and weighted average scores. Weighted average is expected to represent moreprecisely the complexity of different Use Case models in terms of the number of elements and concepts which can be extracted. Inthis context weighted average is calculated as follows        where N is the total number of models used in evaluation   is the actual number of manually extracted concepts for concept of type t in the ith model also presented in Table . is the score obtained for concept of type t in the ith model and.. Experiment resultsTable  depicts the benchmark extraction results which were acquired by manually extracting SBVR concepts and business rulesfrom the given dataset of text rumblings. Total columns represent the actual numbers of particular concepts including duplicateswhile columns under Distinct exclude all the repetitions obtained at each particular step. Values of Total are also used to calculateweighted aggregate scores in Section ..Table  presents the precision and F-Measure scores for the acquired extraction results when a generic POS tagger was used.The results of using a generic POS tagger are quite satisfactory. However as discussed in previous section a generic POS tagger isbiased towards so-called regular language while various modeling practices tend to contain numerous infinitive forms. To mitigatethe impact of this issue we trained our own POS tagger focussing on the recognition of infinitive forms. Several well-known resourceswere used to form a corpus for the training of our POS tagger specifically Brown and CONLL  text corpora together with adataset of reported issues all these sources can be found within resources provided by NLTK toolkit . The selected corpora bestmet our requirements with respect to formal language content of incorporated vocabularies style of writing and already assigned\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R.

All verbs in the selected corpora were converted into their infinitive formsusing NLTK and its internal WordNet lemmatization functionality the resulting corpora were combined with the original texts intoa single corpus which was then used to train the POS tagger. Bidirectional feature extraction was also used to make the tagger moredependent on the context before and after each word which corresponds to heuristics described in Section ... The tagger wasthen applied in our development. The results of the extraction enhanced with custom-trained POS tagger are presented in Table .\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R.

It is observed that for a given set of UML use casemodels the original solution provided somewhat similar results as compared to the results of NLP-enhanced solution. Howeversuch comparison is fair only in the case of non-normalized output i.e. output that does not contain any text normalization orNLP preprocessing and the performance of the original solution would drop significantly if normalized concepts were used for theevaluation. It is much more difficult to match directly outputs of automated extraction which does not use any natural languageprocessing with the compared artefacts containing normalized forms of particular words hence if normalized outputs are usedthe original solution would fail beyond any comparison. For objectivity reasons we provide the extraction results of the originalsolution for both cases in Table  as well.It can be observed that automated extraction resulted in much higher performance when verb concepts or business rules wereextracted. This is clearly explained by the fact that general concepts or verb phrases were formed using less strict normalizationrequirements which resulted in phrases that could be easily matched with original phrases without normalization currentlymatching was performed using plain string matching. However matching with normalized output failed almost completelyconsidering that verbs were not properly matched or normalized... DiscussionAutomatic extraction of SBVR business vocabulary and business rules from labels in UML use case model is a challenging taskhighly influenced by the ambiguity coming from multiple interpretations of certain terms. It can be easily observed from the resultsin Tables  to  that the straightforward extraction Algorithm  did not always produce output as precisely as the improvedstepwise cascaded extraction algorithm Algorithm . However it is assumed that simple extraction algorithm might work betterwith models comprised of elements with relatively simple label names such assumption is supported by the acquired experimentresults. For the future it might be a viable option to introduce some level of automation to heuristically selecting the techniquewhich is expected to provide better extraction results for the specific case.Part-of-speech POS tagger performance plays a major role in the current implementation. As stated before generic taggertools are trained for tagging well-formed and more complete documents which provide more context required to resolve ambiguoussituations. However they are less suitable for tagging short phrases and do not always produce the expected output. Custom trainedtaggers could be a natural option to improve results. Indeed the results show that the application of custom-trained POS tagger oftenresulted in improved performance and aggregate measures indicate overall better performance as well. Yet there were multiplecases when it performed worse than the generic tagger. Such inconsistency can be explained by the fact that our custom-trainedtagger while it is biased towards the identification of infinitive forms of homonymous verbs is now sometimes failing to correctly\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   Table Performance results of the original solution non-normalized and normalized output.Non-normalized outputNormalized outputGCPrecF-scoreVCPrecF-scoreBRPrecF-scoreGCPrecF-scoreVCPrecF-scoreBRPrecF-scoreModel Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model Model AverageWeighted averagetag other words that were handled correctly by the original tagger. Nevertheless considering certain limitations of the corpus usedfor training specificity of input models as well as the tagger itself we consider the achieved results as a considerable improvementover the previously presented case with generic POS tagger. To achieve more stable and consistent performance the developed POStagger will require further investigation and tuning.Lastly the most obvious shortcoming of the original solution introduced in  was its inability to extract correct verb conceptsfrom the text rumblings containing noun phrases verb phrases or verbs followed by prepositions. Given a tuple ActormanagerUseCasesign with digital signature Associationmanager sign with digital signature the simple heuristic transformation rule wouldprovide the following incorrect result manager sign with digital signature the correct non-normalized result would be managersign with digital signature. This shortcoming was overcome in our NLP-enhanced solution. However in our experimental datasetthe great amount of the extracted use cases names comprised single verbs hence a relatively simple heuristics used in the originalsolution was also good enough to show satisfactory extraction results. In this regard it is highly expected that experimenting withlarger sets of use case models representing higher variability of elements naming cases would indicate even greater gap in termsof quality of the results acquired by the original solution and its NLP-enhanced version.. Threats to validityBasic threats to the validity of our experiment results and the approach itself are categorized as follows  a threats toconstruct validity b threats to internal validity and c threats to external validity. All three categories of threats are assessed inthe following subsections... Threats to construct validityTo apply any approach properly one must ensure common understanding of things among all interested parties. However theinterpretability and common understanding of concepts throughout the problem domain has the potential to be handled improperlyin certain settings  this is called a threat to construct validity. This threat was minimal in our research because  all the developedalgorithms were automated and did not leave any space for misinterpreting things  non-automated parts of the approach wereperformed exclusively by the authors who naturally shared common understanding of things... Threats to internal validityInternal validity considers internal factors and how they can affect the results e.g. human error motivation subjectivity. Eventhough the automated nature of the experiment helped to reduce the influence of human factor some threats to internal validityremained.\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   Manual selection of source models for the experiment might be considered as one of such threats because it holds certaindegree of subjectivity especially when considering a relatively small volume of the experimental dataset acquired from these models.Nonetheless the models were carefully selected considering the variety of possible use case modeling cases to test various capabilitiesof the NLP-enhanced model transformation approach. Therefore we state that in this case the subjectivity in the selection of sourcemodels was justified.Another threat to internal validity which is a human error is also related to the set of source models. The thing is that the usecase models were selected from different sources neither of which were ready to be processed automatically by our experimentalsystem. Human errors could appear during this preparation phase. However all the inputs for the experiment were double-checkedand agreed upon by all authors and therefore we assume this threat to be minimal... Threats to external validityExternal validity can be biased by the non-rigorous generalization or failure to generalize the developed approach to a largerextent. As it was stated previously the authors believe that the developed algorithms could be applied to a wider range of UMLmodels as well as other ECore-based models. Here the main threat to external validity is the fact that a relatively small number ofvisual models was selected for the experiment  this objectively lessens the reliability of the acquired experiment results to someextent.Another threat is the lack of standardized modeling practices in particular using certain conventions of naming model elements.In addition there is always a chance that some practitioners will disagree on certain modeling practices used in this research e.g. useof n-ary associations or hierarchical relationships. All this could lead to poorer results compared to the ones presented in this paper.. Related workIn this research we outline the three major areas of related work namely natural language processing conceptual modelsinterpretation and model-driven systems engineering.Natural language processing. Due to the large amount of research carried out in the NLP field we will distinguish only certainpublications presenting most relevant research trends. For more in-depth information on the subject one can consult various surveypapers of recent research such as .In the context of our research we recognize entity extraction relation extraction and named entity recognition as the mostrelevant approaches used in NLP. While earlier developments tend to apply complex machine learning techniques such as maximumentropy optimization  conditional random fields  the most recent developments focus on contextual representationextraction and its extension for different NLP tasks . As more and more computational and data resources become availablerecent trends focus on research in the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques which tend to provide better performance comparedto statistical or feature-based machine learning approaches. Such internal representation learning can be applied for multi-word termrepresentation  grouping of term pairs  embed various lexical resources like WordNet  or lexical dictionaries such asOxford Collins or Cambridge dictionaries  to estimate semantical relation between pairs of words. Relation extraction is alsorelevant in this context relying on linguistic grammatical syntactic dependency structure based pattern extraction  semanticinformation feature based extraction  or using kernel based classifiers such as SVM with tree-based kernels which incorporatesyntactic structure or semantic relation features . Recent findings in deep learning-based research include but are not limitedto applications of recurrent neural networks  convolutional neural networks  graph convolutional networks  ortransformer language models . Whereas current implementation of our approach does not apply the cutting-edge developmentsof this field they are positioned high in our future research list as means to further improving the overall performance of oursolution.Conceptual models interpretation. Another important trend of related research is focused on the interpretation of labels inmodels using natural language techniques which is one of the key points in this research. A solid stream of work is published relatedto similar issues in business process modeling. While the application domain is somewhat different compared the research presentedin this paper it is safe to state that many of the following techniques are transferable to our solution to a certain extent. Leopoldet al.  tries to overcome problem of activity naming misalignment discussed in Section . by proposing a sequential pipelineof four algorithms for activity labeling style identification. Based on such information action and business subject is extracted fromthe label. While it follows grammatical pattern-based approach which is similar to the one in this paper it does not consider exactrelation extraction nor deals with multinary associations. Naming conventions in process model elements were also addressed inmultilanguage settings  where the authors claim of designing a technique transferable to different languages and independentof resources such as WordNet while at the same time making extensive use of text corpora and linguistic knowledge which alsoresonates with our ideas to apply contextual knowledge-based heuristics. At the same time one must admit that obtaining suitablecorpora might be problematic if it concerns languages which are overall less widely used and researched. Further Leopold et al. introduced the notion of canonicity which could be interpreted similarly to atomicity to describe business processes consistingof one action one business object and no more than one addition. This notion is used to describe refactoring for activities withlabels that conform to activity naming antipatterns in  hence the principles in this paper could be one of the extension pointsin the post-processing step as use case modeling also suffers from similar problems Section .. Additionally Pittke  presentsalgorithms to detect homonyms and synonyms in the context of process models which combine semantic vectors with informationobtained from BabelNet resource. Previous attempts to integrate other sources of semantic information  as well as attempts tointegrate them in-between in order to obtain a robust semantic parser  are also notable.\\x0cP. Danenas T. Skersys and R. ButlerisData  Knowledge Engineering   As it was already mentioned recent advancements in NLP attract attention of researchers from the field of model-driven systemsengineering as well. Yet in contrast to our research most authors tend to choose model transformations to the opposite directioni.e. they use natural language specifications as a source to generate visual models in UML BPMN etc. Early works mainly consideredgenerating conceptual data models from natural language specifications as a result a number of pioneering NL-based CASE toolsfor data modeling were introduced . After the introduction of UML research trended to the generation of UML class model. While research on data models was and still remains the most extensive other UML models and modeling notationswere also investigated. Deeptimahanti and Sanyal  tried to generate use case models mainly focusing on role extraction anduse case identification. In their approach sentences were decomposed to atomic subject-predicate phrases further nouns weremapped to actors and verb phrases  to use cases while using prepositions to recognize associations between the created concepts.Generation of UCM from NL specifications is explored by other researchers as well . Some other works concentrate on thetransformations between use case models and other UML models while utilizing various NLP techniques e.g. Christiansen et al. and Sharma et al.  generate class model activity models are generated in  state machine models  in . Next toUML researchers also investigated mining of BPMN process models from different NL-based sources such as group stories  usecase specifications  or generic text . Only one research considered SBVR specifications which is of the most interest to us asa source model for the generation of UML use case models Thakore Upadhyay  however it did not cover a full set of UCMelements only the basic ones such as Actor Use Case and Association. A somewhat larger cluster of related research considers SBVRstandard as a source for the transformation to other UML models. Yet again UML class model remains a preferred target model inthe analyzed works .Generation of natural language specifications from UML models has been researched to a much smaller extent and yet againputting emphasis on UML class model . Cabot et al.  published a comprehensive paper  the presented approach describeddifferent aspects of UMLOCL transformation to SBVR also providing a set of verb patterns and guidelines. Several other works wereaimed at the extraction of SBVR specifications from BPMN process models . Recently alignments between process models andtheir textual descriptions were also investigated to detect automatically inconsistencies between model and text . Neverthelessat the moment of writing we could not find any published research directly dealing with MM transformation-based developmentof SBVR business vocabularies and business rules from UML use case models except for our own early research findings on semi-automatic model transformation  and the latest research results presented in . The later research presents conceptual andengineering aspects on semi-automatic and automatic generation of SBVR specifications from UML use case models and forms thebasis for our research presented in this paper.. Conclusions and future workWhile SBVR-based specifications of business vocabularies and business rules provide certain benefits to all of the interestedparties manual development of these artefacts is tedious and time-consuming task. On the other hand our previous experimentingwith MM transformations showed that the automatic transformation speeds up this task to almost nothing however it is verysensitive to certain modeling practices applied to source models e.g. inconsistent naming of use case concepts resulted in aconsiderably greater number of erroneous SBVR model elements . The application of NLP is one of the ways of diminishingthe impact of bad modeling practices and thus improving the results of model transformation results. This paper contributes to theresearch aimed at intensifying the application of NLP techniques in model-driven information systems development. It extends ourpreviously developed MM transformation approach  by presenting NLP-enhanced pattern-based algorithms for the automaticextraction of SBVR specifications from UML use case diagrams.In this paper we reported experimental findings on the NLP-enhanced extraction of SBVR business vocabularies and businessrules from real world use case models. It provides certain advantages over purely template-based rules e.g. the first word froma use cases name is a verb. Using NLP-enhanced model transformation approach one can now recognize entities entire nounand verb phrases and multinary associations acquiring more complete results and of better quality when compared to the resultsreported in our previous work on model transformation.In addition the developed algorithms improved entity classification accuracy when compared to the results obtained withgeneric NLP tagging. Still there are several other NLP approaches which have not yet been considered in our research  thisincludes but not limited to the use of external sources such as external ontologies lexical databases or simple corpora to implementthe heuristics described in Section . Moreover novel machine learning approaches suggest other advanced ways for improvemente.g. self-learning which would be capable to identify and learn from various errors. Unfortunately actual application of suchadvances in our approach is currently limited by the absence of actual datasets required to test and improve such extractors. Atthe same time corpora which are used for similar NLP-based research do not incorporate specificity nor errors coming fromentity naming practices. In our research we tried to overcome this problem by augmenting existing corpora with modificationsthat allow biasing trained tagger towards such specificity and demonstrated that this could make a positive effect on the extractionperformance. The next steps would be implementation of rule-based algorithms to improve performance as well as to compare themwith machine-learning based tagger used in this paper results in  indicate that application of such techniques have potential toincrease performance. We also expect to overcome this barrier by extending our previously developed tool to enable the recordingof actual modifications made by the tool users  this information could then be turned into features to train the tagger. It is expectedthat such improvement would also provide more flexibility to incorporating different contextual and semantical features.It is safe to state that the developed approach can be generalized over a wider range of other types of UML models and beyond.During the aforementioned VEPSEM research project we successfully developed model transformation rules from several UMLmodel types as well as BPMN process model to SBVR model  all these developments could be enhanced with the presented NLPdevelopment.\\x0cP.
